In this episode of Hunter x Hunter, Gon and Killua challenge Genthru, a cunning and powerful player in the game Greed Island, in a high-stakes battle. Genthru, known for his ability to manipulate and explode his own limbs, demonstrates his prowess by countering Gon's attacks with his aura. Gon, however, surprises Genthru by sacrificing both his hands to attack, taking advantage of Genthru's limited aura reserve. Despite the injury, Gon lands a hit on Genthru, who then reveals his final ability, Countdown, a bomb that can only be disarmed by touching him and saying "I caught the Bomber." Genthru attempts to use Countdown, but Gon and his allies manage to retrieve the stolen cards from Genthru and use Breath of Archangel to heal him. In the end, Gon and his allies decide to give up on the game, and Gon is rewarded with the final card, Maid Panda, as a token of appreciation. The episode concludes with an announcement for a quiz contest for all Greed Island players to test their knowledge of restricted slot cards.
