22,"This country allows ordinary tourists.
 That's where we'll find Killua?
 By airship, it will take three days to reach...
 When do we leave?
 Today! Right now!
 Yeah, no objection from me!
 Understood. Then, I'll order tickets.
 I'm from a family of assassins.
 So they're all assassins.
 And the family has
 really high hopes for me...
 But I can't stand it.
 Who wants to have their life
 planned out for them?
 Killua...
 What's with the long face, Gon?
 We'll be in the Republic of
 Padokea by morning.
 You'll see Killua soon enough.
 Yep!
 We'll definitely take Killua back with us!
 A x Dangerous x Watchdog
 Gon, Leorio, and Kurapika have arrived
 in the Dentora region
 of the Republic of Padokea, where Killua lives.
 There it is.
 The base for this family of
 assassins is on that mountain?
 It sure looks creepy...
 Yes.
 Once we reach our destination,
 we should start gathering information.
 Okay.
 Kukuroo Mountain?
 In that case, you should take the
 scenic mountain bus tour over there.
 The tour only runs once a day,
 but you'll have a guide
 to show you around.
 Okay...
 Thank you for taking the
 Lamentation Tour today.
 We will be visiting Kukuroo Mountain,
 home to the famous Zoldyck
 family of assassins.
 Look.
 They obviously aren't tourists.
 Yes...
 Everyone?
 Please look to your right.
 That is Kukuroo Mountain,
 where the Zoldyck family lives.
 A forest surrounds the 3,722-meter mountain,
 and the Zoldyck estate is
 somewhere on that mountain.
 But no one has ever actually seen it.
 The Zoldyck family includes ten members:
 a great-grandfather, grandfather,
 grandmother, father, mother,
 and then, there are five children.
 All of them are assassins!
 Then, let us approach the mountain.
 That's really something.
 This is the front gate of the Zoldyck estate.
 Also known as the Door to Hades
 because no one who's entered
 has ever returned alive.
 To enter, you must pass through the door
 beside the security checkpoint.
 But the area beyond the gate
 is private property,
 so we can't proceed.
 Hold on!
 This is the front gate?
 The mountain's all the way over there!
 Correct...
 The Zoldycks own Kukuroo Mountain,
 as well as the surrounding land.
 This whole area is their backyard?
 Hey, guide...
 Yes?
 What do we have to do to get inside?
 Little boy, were you listening
 to my explanation?
 Uh-huh.
 But...
 If you go inside, you'll never get out alive!
 Assassins live inside.
 It's all a sham.
 Huh?
 A family of assassins that no one's ever seen.
 Just a photo of their faces is
 worth a hundred million.
 Seriously?!
 Damn!
 I should have taken a picture of Killua!
 It's just another case of rampant rumors
 masking a mundane truth.
 Open the gate!
 I-I cannot do that.
 The master would not be pleased.
 Don't worry.
 We're going to kill your master.
 Ouch...
 Are you okay?
 Yes, I'm fine.
 Man... Now Mike's going to end up
 eating between meals again.
 Huh?
 Please...
 He's only supposed to eat at assigned times.
 Mike!
 Don't blame me if you get fat!
 What was that?
 Hey, boys!
 What are you doing?
 Get on the bus!
 You can leave.
 We're staying here.
 Huh?
 I see.
 So you're young Killua's friends.
 I'm happy to hear that.
 I've worked here for twenty years,
 but this is the first time
 any friends have come to visit.
 Since I work here, I shouldn't say this,
 but the place is rather lonely.
 No one ever visits.
 Though we do see a lot of those...
 Well, a family of assassins is pretty unusual.
 So I suppose it's the price they have to pay.
 Anyway, I'm glad you're here.
 Thank you.
 Don't mention it.
 However...
 I cannot let you inside.
 Didn't you see the large arm of the creature?
 Its name is Mike.
 It serves as the Zoldyck family watchdog.
 It only obeys family,
 and will attack anyone else.
 The beast still follows the order
 its master gave it ten years ago...
 To kill every single intruder.
 But technically, he isn't following the order.
 Because he keeps eating them...
 Anyway, I can't let you inside.
 I wouldn't want to reduce young
 Killua's friends to skeletons.
 Sir, how is it that you're safe?
 You go inside, correct?
 If you never needed to enter,
 you wouldn't have a key.
 Quite perceptive of you.
 But you're only half right.
 I require no key to get inside.
 This key is for intruders.
 A key for intruders?
 For some reason,
 eighty to ninety percent of intruders
 attempt to use the front gate.
 If I don't open the gate for them,
 they'll try to break it down.
 Such troublemakers...
 So we added a locked door to one side.
 The intruders take the key
 from the helpless guard,
 and then Mike eats them.
 A locked door...
 That's it!
 As you just realized, I'm not a guard.
 I merely clean up after Mike.
 And the actual gate isn't locked!
 Exactly.
 What?
 Hunter Vocabulary
 Lamentation Tours
 I've tried pushing and pulling,
 but it won't budge!
 Are you sure it isn't locked?
 You just aren't strong enough.
 That's absurd!
 I've been using all of my strength!
 Just watch.
 This gate's official name is the Testing Gate.
 Anyone who cannot open this gate
 is unqualified to enter the Zoldyck estate.
 As you just saw, the door closes automatically,
 so you'll want to run in, the second it opens.
 You don't need to worry about Mike.
 He has orders not to attack any who
 enter through the Testing Gate.
 Still, this is getting tougher as I age...
 But they'll fire me if I can't open the gate,
 so I need to keep in shape.
 I should mention that each of gate
 one's doors weighs two tons.
 Two tons?
 You're not supposed to be able to open that!
 Wait, what did you say?
 Gate one?
 Yes, have a look.
 There are seven gates.
 When you go up a gate, the weight doubles.
 Doubles?
 The number of gates that open depends
 on the amount of strength you use.
 Incidentally, when young Killua returned,
 he opened gates one through three.
 Gate three?
 That would be twelve tons!
 Sixteen tons, Gon.
 Do you understand now?
 This is what's required just
 to get in the door.
 They live in a completely different world.
 Hmm, I don't like it.
 Mister, lend me the key.
 I came here to see my friend,
 not to be tested.
 You can consider me an intruder.
 So let me borrow the key.
 I'll use the intruder's door.
 Gon!
 Hey...
 It doesn't matter if you
 won't loan me the key.
 I'll just climb the wall, if that's what it takes.
 Don't be stupid, Gon!
 Didn't you see that monster?
 Its arm was bigger than your entire body!
 I won't accept this!
 Why would you test your friends?
 I'll never enter through that door.
 You are absolutely right.
 However, forcing your way
 through is impossible.
 Mike will kill you.
 I agree.
 We have plenty of time.
 Let's figure out a way to
 enter through gate one.
 It's no use.
 He's not gonna change his mind.
 Indeed...
 Unfortunately, I cannot lend you this key.
 I will not feed young Killua's friends to Mike.
 Well, please wait here for a minute.
 Hello? This is Zebro.
 Three of young Killua's
 friends are here to see him.
 Yes.
 Yes, I'm sorry. Yes. Yes.
 Yes, I understand. Yes.
 I'm very sorry. I apologize for disturbing you.
 Yep, I got in trouble.
 You called the mansion?
 No, I was speaking with the
 Zoldyck family butler.
 All communication with the mansion
 must go through the butler.
 It's very difficult to reach any
 of the family members.
 Could you call him again?
 I'll talk to him this time.
 Sure, I guess...
 But you won't enjoy the experience.
 Yes, this is the butler's office.
 I'm Gon, one of Killua-kun's friends.
 Is Killua-kun there?
 Killua-sama has no friends.
 Yes, this is the butler's office.
 How could you possibly know that?!
 Put Killua on the phone!
 I believe you said that you were Gon-kun?
 Yeah.
 Let us pretend that Killua-sama happens
 to have a friend named Gon.
 There is no proof that you are Gon.
 If you put Killua on the phone,
 he'll recognize me!
 By your voice?
 That isn't a reliable test.
 If you put Killua on the phone,
 he'll recognize me!
 That was a simple recording.
 And there are many other ways
 to mimic a person's voice.
 Next, you'll claim that he'd
 recognize you by sight.
 There are only a few methods
 by which you could perfectly mimic
 someone's appearance.
 But it still isn't impossible.
 Additionally, it's possible that someone
 forced you to approach Killua-sama
 for sinister purposes.
 As long as the threat exists,
 I cannot let you meet with Killua-sama.
 The Zoldyck family practices the
 trade of assassination.
 Naturally, it has made enemies.
 As butlers, our duty is to guard our masters
 from their enemies.
 I apologize, but please leave.
 Hey! Gon!
 Gon!
 He's really pissed now.
 He's going to climb over the wall...
 What?
 Hey! Stop it, Gon!
 It's okay. You two can wait here.
 I'll go by myself.
 I can't let you do that!
 I'll be fine!
 No, you won't!
 Both of you should calm down!
 I'm perfectly calm!
 Come down here, Gon!
 Don't be stupid.
 Gon-kun, I'll give you the key.
 You can go through the door.
 Hold on, pops!
 We can convince Gon to stop!
 Really?
 But he appears to be a stubborn boy.
 To make amends,
 I'll accompany you through the door.
 Huh?
 It's possible that Mike
 may recognize me and decide not to attack.
 Though I'm almost a hundred percent
 certain that he'll kill us all.
 You can't do that.
 I don't want to cause you any trouble.
 No, I'm coming with you.
 The result will be the same if I stay behind.
 If I send young Killua's friends to their deaths,
 I'd never be able to face him again.
 If you die,
 I will also die.
 I understand now.
 I didn't stop to consider your situation.
 Sorry.
 He's a good boy.
 He's willing to quell his own anger
 for another person's sake.
 He believes in his own strength,
 as well as in his friends.
 He has a strong heart.
 It's likely that Mike
 won't frighten him at all.
 You must like animals, Gon-kun.
 Yeah.
 Just as I thought.
 Did you grow up playing in the countryside?
 Yep! How did you know?
 Gon-kun, I'm going to open
 the Testing Gate again.
 I want you to see Mike for yourself.
 Hey...
 Is it really okay for us to come in?
 Yes, you'll be safe because you
 entered through the Testing Gate.
 Mike! Come here!
 Gon-kun, do you understand now?
 This is a trained hunting dog.
 It's nothing like the wild animals
 you're accustomed to.
 You must have expected to be able
 to communicate with him.
 Until you saw his eyes.
 Mike is currently
 memorizing the appearances and
 scents of humans he's never seen.
 There's nothing else on his mind.
 He's like a machine.
 Gon-kun, could you fight him?
 No, I'm scared.
 I don't want to fight him!
 He's such an honest boy.
 Well, how long will you be here?
 Until we meet Killua!
 We won't leave before then!
 Then please come this way.
 The Testing Gate...
 And Mike...
 Gon has seen that the Zoldyck family
 lives in a completely different world.
 However, Gon had promised himself...
 No matter what difficulties awaited him,
 he would find Killua in the end.

 The x Guard's x Duty
 Gon and his friends have confronted
 the obstacles that they must overcome
 in order to meet with Killua.
 What awaits them at their destination?
 Here are the servants' quarters.
 It's getting late.
 So you can stay here tonight.
 Please come in.
 Hey, I'm back!
 Oh, you rarely bring guests.
 This is Seaquant.
 He works with me here.
 Good evening.
 If you managed to win over Zebro,
 you must be special.
 Well, make yourselves at home.
 Though it won't be easy here.
 You want to see young Killua?
 That's a riot!
 Sorry. But we're dead serious.
 Then let me give you a warning:
 Give up, and go home.
 What was that?!
 Zebro told you about the
 Testing Gate, right?
 That should give you an idea of
 what this place is like.
 We understand that it won't be easy.
 But I'm not leaving.
 Not until I see Killua!
 When Killua was in trouble,
 I wasn't there for him.
 If I had been there,
 I could have stopped Killua!
 Killua is my close friend!
 We understand.
 Then why not do some training here?
 Training?
 Hey, Zebro...
 Listen to me, Gon-kun.
 You three are allowed to work together
 to open the door.
 With a little training, it should be possible.
 How about it?
 I don't like the idea of being tested...
 But if there is no other way...
 We'll just have to do it!
 Yep!
 Then I'll need you to put these on.
 How is this so heavy...
 It weighs fifty kilograms.
 Please wear it at all times,
 except while you sleep.
 I'll make it heavier as you get used to it.
 Please have some tea.
 What the...?
 The cups weigh twenty kilograms.
 This teapot weighs forty kilograms.
 All furniture and utensils in this house
 weigh over twenty kilograms apiece.
 I see... So this will serve as training.
 It's useless.
 They'll give up in two or three days.
 What was that?
 Seaquant, I believe that
 your shift has already started.
 Oh, that's right...
 Sorry about that.
 He isn't a bad person.
 By the way, where's the bathroom?
 Through the door over there.
 I'm guessing that
 the door is also...
 Yes, it weighs five hundred kilograms.
 Five hundred?
 What?! Get out!
 I can't hold it in!
 Kalluto-chan, open the door.
 Kil, have you learned your lesson yet?
 It's no use, Mama.
 He isn't even the least bit sorry.
 We need to make him suffer more.
 Milluki! Shut your mouth!
 Kil, stop being so stubborn
 and say that you're sorry.
 Oh, right. That friend of yours...
 Gon, was it?
 He'd be better off just leaving,
 but it sounds like he wants
 to try the Testing Gate.
 Gon is here...
 Milluki! You're talking too much!
 Listen to me, Kil...
 You didn't even tell me?!
 Don't yell at Mama!
 I told you to shut your mouth!
 I didn't think I needed to tell you, Kil...
 Since it's impossible for him
 to open the front gate.
 He'll do it.
 What?
 Gon will open it.
 Oh, that's nice.
 But he'll still never make it here...
 Gon will...
 He'll do it.
 He will definitely make it here.
 Wait, Gon!
 You just watch.
 Huh? Why?
 You need to let your arm heal first.
 As long as Kurapika and I can open it,
 it doesn't matter.
 Let us handle this!
 Okay.
 Let's do this, Kurapika!
 Yeah!
 It's impossible...
 No use... It won't budge an inch.
 Damn!
 But we just started our training.
 If we work hard enough, we can do it!
 I wish I could share your optimism.
 This will never work.
 You kids need to wake up.
 In that case,
 you should quit watching us
 and do your job!
 Gon is one of us.
 And he wishes to see his friend.
 It's only right that we should help him.
 Okay, let's give it another shot!
 Yeah!
 Man, you can't just mindlessly push.
 Match your timing.
 You have to push both doors,
 with all your strength, simultaneously.
 Or the gate won't ever open.
 Match our timing...
 And push both doors with all our
 strength simultaneously...
 Okay!
 One!
 Two!
 Three!
 Leorio! Kurapika!

 Oh, well...

 Very well.
 He's always so cold.
 Hey, why don't you try removing
 those vests today?
 Oh? Music to my ears!
 Yeah!
 Without them, we can
 definitely open the gate now.
 Let's do this, Kurapika!
 Yeah!
 One... Two...
 Three!
 Damn it...
 It won't move any farther.
 One last spurt, Leorio...
 Got it!
 Gon...
 Why are you using your left arm?
 It's okay.
 My arm's healed now.
 Healed?
 Are you sure, Gon?
 Yep!
 Anyway, we have to push together, right?
 Right, let's push!
 Here we go!
 One!
 Two!
 Three!
 It's opening...
 Ow...
 It opened.
 Yes!
 We did it, Gon!
 Uh-huh!
 Follow the path, and head for the mountain.
 The mansion should be somewhere up there.
 I'm ashamed to admit
 that even though I've worked
 here for twenty years,
 I've never been up the mountain.
 Sorry that I couldn't be any help.
 No, that isn't true.
 You've both been a huge help.
 Thank you for everything!
 Goodbye!
 Those kids are really something.
 They might be able to
 make it to the mansion.
 Won't happen. They'll just
 get themselves killed.
 Speaking from your experience
 three years ago?
 We were wiped out by an apprentice butler.
 That made it painfully clear
 that I wasn't on their level.
 So you decided to work here.
 Sorry...
 But the masters and servants
 are all monsters.
 Once you step into their territory...
 The Testing Gate opened?
 Yes, ma'am.
 This is a critical time for Killua.
 We cannot allow anyone near him!
 Especially not those unnecessary friends...
 Do you understand?
 Yes, ma'am.
 Leave.
 You're trespassing on private property.
 I cannot allow you to pass
 without permission.
 We called ahead.
 And we came through the Testing Gate.
 The butlers did not give you
 permission to enter.
 What do we need to do to get permission?
 I said I was Killua's friend,
 but they wouldn't put him on.
 I wouldn't know.
 Because no one has ever
 received permission.
 Then we'll have to trespass!
 I suppose so.
 In any case, this is where I draw the line.
 If you take one step beyond this line,
 I'll remove you by force.
 Gon!
 Damn it!
 Leorio! Kurapika!
 Don't interfere.
 Let me handle this.
 Ow...
 We don't intend to fight you.
 We just want to see Killua.
 It doesn't matter what your motives are.
 I'm simply following my orders.
 You can try all you want.
 I'll never let you pass.
 I will pass...
 I'm going to see Killua!
 Welcome home,
 Killua-sama.
 Yeah.
 I made...
 a friend...
 Stop it.
 Stay away!
 Cut it out!
 Don't you realize how futile this is?!
 Why don't you stop him?
 Aren't you his friends?
 What's the problem?
 I'm just here to see my friend.
 I'm just here to see Killua!
 Why do I have to do this?!
 Hey.
 Huh?
 I crossed the line.
 Aren't you supposed to hit me?
 You're different from Mike.
 You may try to hide your feelings,
 but you have a heart.
 When I mentioned Killua,
 your eyes softened for a moment.
 Please...
 Help Killua-sama—
 Honestly...
 What was that servant babbling about?
 She made it sound like we're
 being mean to Killua.
 A worthless apprentice had
 the nerve to insult us!
 You must be Gon.
 I heard about you from Illumi.
 Killua knows that you're here.
 I have a message for you from Kil...

 a little closer to the mansion.

 I'm home.
 Well, no one's around.
 Welcome back.
 How did work go?
 Fine.
 Does that mean you dispatched your target?
 I'm sure you were watching me
 from a distance.
 Mom's waiting for you inside.
 I don't want to see her.
 Ah.
 Did you need something?
 I wanted to say hello.
 Are you new here?
 Yes.
 While you were away,
 I was hired as an apprentice butler.
 My name is Canary.
 Here. You can have this.
 No, thank you.
 But I appreciate the thought, Killua-sama.
 Don't be so formal. Just call me Killua.
 I cannot do that.
 I am a servant.
 And you are my employer.
 Tsk... That's lame.
 You were using the Shadow Step, right?
 Shadow Step?
 The technique where you move silently,
 so you won't be noticed.
 It's one of the first assassination
 techniques we learn
 in the Zoldyck family.
 Is that so?
 I must have learned it while
 growing up in Meteor City.
 Meteor City?
 My hometown.
 It's a city that has been erased from this world.
 Huh, never heard of it.
 You're allowed to dump anything in Meteor City.
 That's why many members
 of the mafia and the Phantom
 Troupe come from there.
 I'd like to visit some time.
 When you visit, I can serve as your guide.
 I'll teach you the Rhythm Echo.
 Rhythm Echo?
 It's a technique that utilizes the Shadow Step.
 You move at a certain rhythm,
 creating afterimages.
 I see...
 It appears we have intruders.
 Many intruders.
 Let Mike handle it.
 The master has ordered that
 Mike be restrained today.
 They wish to test my abilities.
 We'll split up and look for their mansion.
 Leave.
 Who are you?
 There is no need for me to answer that question.
 You are trespassing on private property.
 I cannot allow you to pass without permission.
 Can you stop us?
 It's obvious that you stand no chance.
 Well, if you don't resist, we'll spare your life.
 If you take one step past this line,
 I shall use force to remove you.
 What was that?
 You can stand back and watch, boss...
 We'll take care of this.
 Let's go!
 Don't mock us!
 Bitch!
 Get her!
 Do you wish to continue?
 After all that, she hasn't
 even broken a sweat...
 Are you a member of the Zoldyck family?
 Hardly.
 I am but an apprentice butler.

 you're not even a match for the butlers,

 Sorry. It was the wrong thing to do, Bro.
 You're lying!
 You can tell?

 Oh, Mama?
 Uh-huh.

 Kil,
 your friends are near the butler's office.

 Forgive me for not introducing myself.
 I am Killua's mother.
 This is Kalluto.
 Why can't Killua come see us?
 Because he's in solitary confinement.
 Solitary confinement?
 Kil stabbed me and his brother
 before he ran away from home.
 That is the story he told us.
 Kil returned because he regretted his actions.
 And he voluntarily entered
 solitary confinement.
 So we do not know when he will leave...
 What? Father! What are you doing?!
 Don't do anything hasty!
 He's finally returned!
 I'm coming in.

 But, Grandpa Zeno...

 I know that.
 Kil, you can go.

 But I do feel bad.
 So I let you slap me around.

 Kil, Silva wants to see you.
 Dad?
 Okay.
 Damn it!
 You always spoil Kil, Grandpa!
 That's why he's such an uppity brat...
 He's special.
 Mil, what do you think of Kil's potential?
 It's incredible, sure.
 He's probably the most talented
 Zoldyck in history?
 Mama seems to think so.
 I have to agree.
 Considerable praise.
 But he fails as an assassin
 because he's so moody.
 Moody?
 A kid who wants to make friends
 can't lead the Zoldyck family.
 In the end, he's just a crybaby.
 Mentally weak.
 That is true...
 Right? Take me.
 I'll kill anyone I'm asked to.
 Oh, that's right.
 The bomb I'll use next time
 is awesome, Grandpa!
 It's super-compact.
 I attached it to a female mosquito,
 and it's triggered to explode when the
 mosquito sucks the target's blood.
 But the problem is getting the mosquito
 to recognize the target...
 Mil...
 You're a bright boy,
 but that foolish nature of yours doesn't help.
 Oh, why must Father be this way?
 Something has come up.
 So I bid you farewell.
 Please wait!
 We'll be staying in town for a while.
 Please let Killua know.
 Very well. I shall tell him.
 Goodbye.
 Who are you?
 Killua's friends.
 Friends...
 Kalluto-chan! What are you doing?
 Come over here!
 Yes, Mother.
 I probably shouldn't say it,
 but these people creep me out...
 And I bet they were lying about Killua's
 saying that he can't see us.
 Gon, we can't go back yet.
 How about we tail them?
 Sure, but if we do that,
 she'll take the blame.
 Oh, right...
 I will take you to the butler's office.
 There is a phone that connects to the mansion.
 If Zeno-sama is the one who answers...
 Zeno-sama?
 Killua-sama's grandfather.
 Kil.
 I heard that you've made some friends?
 Yeah.
 What sort of people are they?
 What sort of...?
 They're people I enjoy being with.
 I see.
 How was the Exam?
 It was easy.
 Kil, come over here.
 Huh?
 I want you to tell me more.
 What did you do during the Exam?
 Who did you meet? How did you feel?
 You can tell me anything...
 Okay.
 I can't believe this.
 Father didn't even ask me first.
 Oh, Kil seems to be having fun with Papa...
 I won't forgive them!
 And guess what Gon said next...
 He didn't want his legs cut off,
 but he didn't want to surrender, either!
 He's so self-centered.
 Sounds like an interesting boy.
 And then his opponent
 pointed a blade at Gon's forehead,
 but Gon still...
 Kil.
 Huh?
 Do you want to see your friends?
 You don't need to hold back.
 Tell me the truth.
 Thinking back,
 we've never had a father-son chat before.
 I was raised by my parents to be an assassin.
 And I raised you the same way.
 You and I are different.
 I didn't realize that until you left home.
 You are my son.
 But you are your own person.
 Live as you please.
 If you get tired, you can come home.
 I'll ask you one more time.
 Do you want to see your friends?
 Uh-huh.
 I understand.
 You're free now.
 But...
 Promise me one thing.
 Never betray your friends.
 Understand?
 I promise.
 I'll never betray them.
 Never.
 Kil.
 It's too late. Those three left.
 Return to your cell.
 No way. I'm leaving.
 Kil!
 Out of my way.
 Oh, Kil...
 Your eyes are so cold now...
 What were you thinking?
 Kil was finally home!
 For now, we'll let him do what he wants.
 No! What are you saying?
 This is a critical juncture in the process
 of determining if he's qualified
 to lead the family!
 So you understand what's at stake.
 Then stop griping, and keep your mouth shut!
 He'll come home one day.
 Because he is my son.
 Killua has been set free.
 But Silva declares that Killua
 will return as an assassin.
 Meanwhile, Gon and his friends
 head to the butler's office.
 Will they be able to see Killua?
 Next time: Can't See x If x You're Blind!

 Eye for a tooth?
 Tooth for a tooth!

 After a discussion with the father he admires,
 Killua leaves his home again,
 despite his mother's objections.
 Gon and his friends are led by Canary
 to the butler's office,
 to attempt to meet with Killua.
 Aren't we there yet?
 We still have a while to go.
 How much walking do we have to do...
 Honestly, I cannot believe this!
 Kil was finally home!
 But the men allowed him to leave again!
 And Father is just as guilty!
 He released Kil without permission!
 Really,
 this always happens!
 They never ask me before they act.
 Do you understand, Gotoh?
 Yes, ma'am.
 Th-This is a most critical time for Kil...
 Why don't they understand?
 He's the one child I shall not give up!
 There it is.
 That building?
 But it's still pretty far away.
 Say, Canary.
 Won't you get in trouble
 for bringing us here?
 They already know what I'm doing.
 So I am prepared to take the consequences.
 If there's any trouble, I'll take responsibility.
 No.
 I'm merely serving as a guide
 for Killua-sama's friends.
 Killua-sama, we've been waiting for you.
 Gotoh, where's Gon now?
 You do know, right?
 Canary is bringing Gon-sama here,
 along with his two friends.
 Really?
 They should arrive shortly,
 so please wait inside.
 Okay.
 Gotoh.
 Yes, sir.
 Let me know the second Gon gets here.
 Yes, sir.
 I shall notify you immediately.
 Forgive me, Killua-sama.
 Hey, we finally made it.
 Welcome.
 Please forgive the rude reception.
 The lady of the house has
 asked us to treat you
 as official guests.
 Is that better?
 Thanks.
 Then this is not the primary residence?
 No, this place is for the butlers.
 Well, please make yourselves at home.
 I appreciate the hospitality,
 but we've come to see Killua.
 Can you take us to him at once?
 That won't be necessary.
 Killua-sama is on his way here.
 Really?
 Yes, so please wait a little longer.
 That's great news, Gon!
 Yeah!
 Now, then...
 To simply sit and wait would be dull.
 How about a game, to pass the time?
 A game?
 Which hand holds the coin?
 The left hand.
 Correct.
 So I'll move more quickly this time.
 Well? Which hand?
 Left again.
 Marvelous.
 Then I shall try harder this time.
 Well? Which hand?
 I'm not positive, but I'd guess the right.
 You see...
 I have known Killua-sama his entire life.
 I dare say that I care for him
 as though he were my own.
 In all honesty,
 I must despise you for trying
 to take him away.
 Well? Which hand?
 Answer.
 The left hand.
 His lady mother could barely speak...
 She must be heartbroken,
 having to watch him leave.
 I cannot forgive it.
 By the time Killua-sama arrives,
 a decision will be reached.
 I shall test you in my own way.
 You have no choice.
 Canary!
 This is her punishment for having
 brought you here, against her orders.
 I shall explain the rules.
 If one of you answers incorrectly,
 that person is out of the games.
 Should you all be disqualified,
 I shall tell Killua-sama that you left.
 And that he will never see you again.
 Killua is...
 Silence!
 Your lives hang by a thread.
 Now, answer my question.
 Which hand?
 I couldn't see it...
 Don't take too long.
 You have three seconds to answer.
 Hey...
 After three seconds have passed,
 slit her throat.
 Okay.
 Wait! Left hand!
 I pick the right hand!
 Me, too!
 One disqualified.
 This is futile.
 I can't see anything!
 Which hand?
 I choose the right hand.
 I pick the left.
 It was in my left hand.
 Only one remains now.
 Here I go.
 One second!
 What is it?
 If you're trying to buy time,
 I'll kill one of your friends.
 Leorio, lend me your knife.
 Huh?
 Don't worry.
 I won't use it for anything stupid.
 That's it...
 He's bleeding himself, to reduce the swelling.
 Man, how long do I have to wait?
 Hey, Gotoh!
 Anyone around?
 What's going on?
 Okay!
 Now I can see.
 Give me your best!
 Which hand?
 Left hand.
 Not bad.
 In that case...
 Who now holds the coin?
 Hunter Vocabulary

 The person right behind me.
 Brilliant.
 Gotoh, is Gon here yet?
 Killua!
 Oh! You're here, Gon!
 Along with...
 Kurapika?
 I'm just an afterthought?
 Liorio!
 Leorio!
 It's been a while.
 I can't believe you came.
 What happened?
 Your face is a wreck!
 Yours isn't any better!
 Hey, Gotoh.
 I told you to let me know
 as soon as they arrived.
 What were you doing?
 Forgive me.
 I had them participate in a little game.
 A game?
 It was nothing more than a poor joke.
 I apologize for any aggravation.
 Did you enjoy yourselves?
 That was really good acting...
 What? Did they try something?
 No, they were entertaining us.
 Really?
 Well, whatever.
 Anyway, let's go somewhere else.
 Anywhere else, right now.
 If we stay here, my mother
 will give us an earful!
 Yeah!
 Hey, Gotoh.
 Listen up.
 I don't care what Mother says.
 Don't follow me.
 Understood. Please take care.
 Gon, let's go.
 Bye.
 Gotoh-san.
 Once Killua leaves, you'll be lonely, huh?
 No.
 We butlers feel no emotional attachment
 to our employers.
 You're lying.
 Gon-kun...
 Well? Which hand?
 Isn't it your left hand?
 What? No way!
 Indeed. It was a deception.
 In this world, there are many
 things that are wrong.
 Please be careful.
 I am entrusting Killua-sama to you.
 Bye, Canary!
 Took you long enough, Gon!
 Sorry about that.
 Let's make ourselves scarce
 before more trouble comes.
 Yeah, he's used that trick on me before.
 Once you know the secret,
 it's so simple, it'll make you mad.
 Huh? Really?
 I'm assuming this was what he did.
 Which hand?
 It's your left hand, right?
 Huh? How?
 Hey, how did you do that?
 Gotoh held two coins.
 Huh? But he only had the one.
 Anyway, he hid a coin in his right hand,
 while flipping the other.
 And then he let us see him grab
 the coin using his left hand.
 But before he asked us
 which hand held the coin,
 he raised both arms,
 and he slipped the first coin into his sleeve.
 That left the coin in his right hand.
 You got it.
 That really makes me mad.
 Well, I'm fairly certain he only used
 the trick on the final turn.
 Gotoh hates cheating, even if it's just a game.
 That's even worse!
 What?
 You're here on a tourist visa?
 Uh-huh.
 Didn't you pass the Hunter Exam?
 You could've just used your Hunter License.
 It lets you stay in other countries
 for as long as you want.
 That's what we said.
 I already decided.
 I'm not using the license until I've
 finished what I need to do.
 What do you have to do?
 The tag
 that Hisoka gave me!
 I'll only take it back
 when you're able to punch me
 in the face, just like that.
 Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.
 I'll return it to Hisoka when
 I punch him in the face!
 Until I do that, I won't use my Hunter License.
 I can't go back to Whale Island, either.
 Hmm...
 So, where's Hisoka?
 Uh...
 Thought so...
 I know where he is, Gon.
 Huh? Really?
 How?
 He told me.
 So that's what he said...
 No, this was after the orientation.
 But it's still related, right?
 I suppose so.
 I've been itching to ask...
 What did Hisoka say to you?
 He told me...
 I have some information for you
 regarding the spider.
 The Phantom Troupe?
 I do not recall mentioning the
 Phantom Troupe to Hisoka.
 So either he overheard our conversation
 during the first stage,
 or he heard of it from another.
 The spider is the Phantom Troupe's symbol,
 so those familiar with the organization
 refer to the Troupe as such.
 I was interested in his information.
 I see...
 So that's why you swallowed your pride
 and accepted Hisoka's surrender.
 After the orientation, I asked him about it.
 I shall await you in Yorknew City,
 on September 1st.
 September 1st?
 Then you've still got over half a year.
 What's going to happen in Yorknew City?
 They'll hold the world's largest auction.
 Correct.
 From September 1st through September 10th,
 there will be an auction
 for unusual items, rare goods,
 and national treasures from around the world.
 The event attracts all manner of nasty folk
 who come looking to satisfy their greed.
 It's the biggest gathering of money in the world.
 So the Troupe will be there?
 They're a group of bandits.
 They would not let this chance escape.
 So on that day, Hisoka will be
 somewhere in Yorknew City.
 Okay. September 1st.
 Got it. Thanks.
 Then I shall depart now.
 Huh?
 We managed to see Killua again,
 so I'm finished here.
 I'll need money to participate in the auction.
 So I shall search for a patron
 to employ me as a Hunter.
 Really...
 I guess I should go home, then.
 You, too?
 I haven't given up my dream
 of becoming a doctor.
 If I'm accepted to medical school,
 I can use this to pay the ridiculous fee.
 I'll have to go back and start cramming.
 Uh-huh, good luck.
 Until we meet again.
 Yes, that will be...
 September 1st, in Yorknew City.
 See ya.
 Bye-bye!
 It's just the two of us now.
 Hey, what do you want to do?
 You have to ask? We train, obviously.
 Huh? Train for what?
 Shouldn't we have some fun?
 Do you remember what you just said?
 Think you can punch Hisoka in
 the face without training?
 You couldn't land a punch
 in ten years, let alone six months!
 Okay.
 Here, I'll make it easy to understand.
 This is Hisoka. This is Hanzo.
 Uh-huh...
 If this is the gap between Hisoka
 and Hanzo, in terms of strength,
 the gap between Hisoka and you
 is this far!
 And I'm being generous.
 Now I'm mad...
 Then where are you?
 Me?
 Well, probably around here.
 Yep... I'm so humble.
 Oh, Hanzo is stronger?
 What is it?
 You really are amazing!
 Cut that out... It's embarrassing.
 I don't know how to tell the
 difference in strength
 between my opponent and myself.
 Stupid. It doesn't matter.
 I'm only estimating.
 You probably have a general idea.
 Once you have enough experience,
 your guess will become more accurate.
 Besides, the stronger someone is,
 the better they are at hiding that strength.
 So you shouldn't rely on this method.
 Oh...
 Well, in any case, Hisoka is strong.
 Yeah.
 You won't land a blow on him in six
 months through normal means.
 Gon, do you have any money?
 Actually, I'm running out.
 I don't have much, either.
 But there's somewhere we can train and
 earn money at the same time.
 Train and earn money?
 The Heavens Arena.
 Heavens Arena...
 Yeah, I'll explain later.
 We should get moving.
 Okay!
 After bidding farewell to Kurapika and Leorio,
 with promises to meet again in Yorknew City,
 Gon and Killua now head to a new stage,
 the Heavens Arena.
 Next time: Then x And x After!

 I like salty and spicy.

 You don't.

 There's something I really want!
 Tell me what it is that you want.
 I want to become friends with Gon...
 I'm sick of killing people...
 I want to become friends with Gon,
 and to live a normal life...
 That's impossible.
 You'll never be able to make friends.
 Because you have the soul of a killer.

 that the fight has begun.

 Don't bother apologizing.

 but you have a heart.

 your eyes softened for a moment.
 Please...
 Help Killua-sama—
 You must be Gon.
 I heard about you from Illumi.
 Killua knows that you're here.
 Why can't Killua come see us?
 Because he's in solitary confinement.

 And he voluntarily entered
 solitary confinement.

 ""The business I still need to take care of
 is left over from the exam's Fourth Phase.""
 I will need you to draw lots.
 Lots?
 For what?
 To determine who will hunt
 and who will be hunted.
 Listen carefully!
 Your target's ID tag is worth three points.
 Your own ID is also worth three points.
 All other ID tags are worth one point.
 You need six points to advance
 to the Final Phase.
 So while on Zevil Island,
 you must gather enough ID tags
 to total six points.
 That is the condition for clearing
 the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.
 What number did you draw?
 Show each other our numbers

 I might actually have a chance.
 That scares me a little...
 But I think it's worth it.
 Now!
 I did it!

 I have to aim for my target as
 he hunts his own prey!
 There!
 At this rate, Hisoka will spot him
 in the next minute.
 I have to figure out where

 Damn... Bring it!

 I took Hisoka's tag!
 Approximately, seven thousand.
 Do you know what that
 number represents?

 I had to kill you.
 It's also the number of times you swung
 your fishing rod when you were training.
 Next time, remember to
 watch your own back.
 So long.
 Damn it...
 You surprise me.
 You hid your presence,
 while waiting for your chance?
 Waiting for me to attack another?
 Did you teach yourself how
 to conceal your presence?
 Marvelous...
 Like a wild animal.
 And your timing was impeccable.
 You concealed all traces of your attack
 by timing it with my own attack.
 A splendid job.
 Wait...
 Didn't you come to take back your tag?
 No, I just came to commend you.
 You owe me one now.
 Feel free to pay me back when you want.
 Goodbye.
 I don't want to owe anyone...
 You can have it back now.
 I refuse.
 Right now, I'm letting you live.
 And I'll continue to keep you alive,
 until you've grown enough
 to be worth killing...
 I'll only take it back
 when you're able to punch me
 in the face, just like that.
 Until then, I shall leave the tag with you.

 So I need to find a way to return the favor.
