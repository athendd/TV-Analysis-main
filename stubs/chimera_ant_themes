100,"Someone's running around
 and disabling my puppets.
 Can you kill them?
 You can count on me.
 Hmm... No problem.
 You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.
 I will stop them all.
 Tracking x And x Pursuit
 Knuckle and Shoot are on the
 move to capture Cheetu
 as he attempts to return to the King.
 He's close.
 Okay.
 He's following the road.
 If he continues on it,
 he'll pass by in ten minutes.
 Do you think he'll stick to the road?
 No, he'll notice my presence
 just before he gets here.
 Because APR will start adding interest again.
 But given his speed...
 We may be able to attack him
 just before APR adds interest.
 I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
 Knuckle's ability, Chapter 7 Bankruptcy,
 attaches APR to an enemy.
 Every ten seconds, APR informs the
 enemy that interest will be added.
 But if the enemy is over a hundred meters
 away from Knuckle, the interest stops.
 When this happens, the time
 until the next interest payment
 is remembered by APR.
 Once the enemy is back within
 Knuckle's hundred-meter range,
 APR picks up where it stopped.
 He's approaching at a speed between
 160 and 180 kilometers per hour.
 If there are still three seconds or more
 before APR adds interest again,
 there's a good chance we can
 attack before he notices us.
 Here he comes!
 What's wrong?
 Damn, what happened?
 At the last second, he suddenly changed direction!
 He's down below!
 Knuckle...
 Don't bother. We can't catch up.
 Our opponent has a cheetah's speed.
 He isn't supposed to know
 how to deal with Zetsu.
 How did he discover our ambush?
 Could it be...
 We're slightly downwind.
 The breeze is blowing this way
 with no change in direction.
 So he didn't smell us.
 Look up!
 What's that?
 I've discovered two suspicious figures.
 What should I do?
 Ignore them. They aren't the target.
 No point in doing more work than necessary.
 Yes, sir.
 It appears they were trying
 to ambush Cheetu-sama.
 Oh, he's in the area?
 I warned Cheetu-sama before he ran into their trap.
 Was that unnecessary?
 What did Cheetu do?
 He took a detour toward the capital.
 He told me to thank you for the help.
 I see, good work.
 He owes me now.
 This is Leol.
 The target just engaged a squad of
 soldiers in the city of Longtong.
 Longtong?
 Head north and try to cut it off.
 Just a hunch.
 Understood.
 Looks like even the army can't handle this.
 No... Well, they're only there to buy time.
 They've had to stay in one area
 for a longer period of time.
 After all, it's been moving constantly
 for over thirty hours.
 Diego has fallen into enemy hands!
 If you stay in your homes, you'll be killed!
 Liar!
 Rebel scum!
 Damn... Diego just appeared on TV,
 looking alive and well.
 The odds are against me now.
 I'll have to give up my instigation.
 My only option is to take out as many
 puppets and soldiers as I can!
 Should I go north next?
 I knew it.
 Someone's still following me!
 Who's there?!
 If you want something, show yourself!
 The presence has completely vanished.
 It might be following me until
 more Chimera Ants show up.
 I'm gonna shake it!
 It can't outlast me!
 Yo...
 Yo.
 Sorry for stopping you.
 Nah, I was headed this way.
 The King's in this direction, right, Hagya?
 Yeah, I know. It's Leol now.
 Then you did that on purpose?
 You're still a bastard.
 Flutter's warning was a big help.
 Right now, I'm trying to avoid fights...
 I'm glad to hear that.
 By the way, what's that thing?
 No idea.
 A Hunter hit me with it.
 It follows me wherever I run.
 Not sure what to do.
 But so far, it doesn't seem to have any effect.
 Want me to get rid of it?
 Do you want me to get rid of it?
 You can do that?
 Probably.
 But not for free, right?
 I'm glad you're so understanding.
 Figured.
 The Royal Guard has assigned me a mission.
 I'd like your help.
 Leol-sama...
 I've spotted the target.
 He's headed north on the road through
 the forest northeast of Longtong.
 Neferpitou-dono's hunch was right...
 Don't let him get away.
 Use all your forces to slow him down.
 Yes, sir.
 We're chasing down a human.
 He's probably a Hunter.
 And you want me to help hunt him?
 You said he's a Hunter?
 They can be tough to deal with...
 Of course, so I've planned ahead.
 Shaiapouf-dono has prepared
 a power tailored for you.
 He will teach you to use it.
 With luck, you can master it in a day.
 I'm a slow learner, so mine took me
 three days to get the hang of.
 Sounds like a sweet deal...
 In return, I swear loyalty to the King?
 Exactly... Easy enough, right?
 Sure, I just wanted an explanation.
 You're a sharp fellow.
 If you accept, return to the castle,
 master your new power,
 and then contact me.
 In the meantime, I'll have my underlings
 determine the target's abilities.
 Well, I guess I owe you one.
 Might as well.
 Anyway, you're still all about stealing glory.
 Naturally.
 I was once king of the jungle.
 Obviously, you're looking to retake the throne.
 Damn, I'm being followed.
 And he's way out of yo-yo range.
 If I don't lose him or defeat him, I'll be in trouble.
 There's a jungle over there!
 The leaves are dense enough,
 he shouldn't be able to see me from the air.
 If he descends to follow,
 he'll be in range of my yo-yo!
 He isn't coming?
 Did I lose him?
 But in that case, he should
 come looking for me.
 Damn...
 I don't have time to wait around!
 Hurry up, already!
 You can't hide from me.
 Go forth, soldiers of Leol.
 Capture your prey!
 Something's coming, but from the opposite side,
 and it's on the ground!
 He removed his foe's head
 and arms with one swing!
 I can't beat him in a one-on-one,
 close-quarters fight...
 Where is he?!
 Captain! Above you!
 I'm gonna die—
 I missed two of them!
 We're attacking him en masse, in the treetops,
 and we can't even touch him!
 Retreat!
 Time to regroup!
 I won't let you escape...
 You must be the leader.
 I'll eliminate you first!
 How'd you like that blast?
 That bastard...
 He blew a fart at me!
 No, there's a bigger problem...
 I completely concealed my presence,
 and attacked from his blind spot.
 But he countered at the perfect time.
 Someone must be instructing
 him from a distance.
 It must be him!
 He's probably watching right now.
 I'd guess he has a power that
 lets him track my location.
 In that case...
 I can't show him the cards
 in my hand, no matter what.
 I don't want them to learn
 of my lightning or yo-yo!
 The ideal scenario would be to lose
 them and go back into hiding.
 But that's looking impossible.
 I'll have to defeat them all without using—
 A gun?
 No...
 There's something stuck to my face...
 A flea?
 A flea?
 Damn!
 Where did it come from?!
 Area TH-88, X-15, Y-12, Z-2.
 Point X-9, Y-3, Z-1.
 Okay.
 There's no escaping...
 from my Fleadom, oh yeah.
 Damn!
 The bleeding won't stop.
 These fleas are more than just big bugs...
 Area P-9, Y-7, X-8, Z-4.
 Point Y-5, X-3, Z-1.
 Okay.
 The sniper isn't trying to deal serious damage.
 The real goal is to exhaust my
 strength through blood loss!
 My fleas are very special...
 They have a 200-meter vertical leap.
 And when you factor in...
 my air gun's power,
 they become unstoppable, oh yeah.
 Oh? He's already able to dodge them?
 No wonder those apes couldn't do anything.
 If I keep running around, it'll be
 harder for them to snipe me!
 But I have to conserve stamina.
 Ah, he's going to try something.
 He may try to use his power.
 Let's see what he can do.
 Okay.
 My Super Eye allows me to observe a target
 from multiple angles via my Satellite Dragonflies.
 No ability you use can escape my sight.
 Now, let's see what you do.
 Killua cannot use En.
 Expanding his aura around him
 and maintaining it for a long time
 is by no means his forte.
 Killua knows this shortcoming.
 And so, he keeps his aura within
 the range he can best manage.
 A mere fifty-seven centimeters from his body.
 Not much room to work with.
 In other words, the moment a projectile is
 within fifty-seven centimeters of his body,
 Killua must rely on his incredible reflexes
 and physical strength to react
 with desperate speed,
 and dodge at point-blank range.
 But this time, he didn't dodge!
 All to determine the angle of
 the projectile's approach.
 Damn... It came from this way!
 He let himself be hit, so he
 could locate the sniper.
 The target is quickly heading your way.
 Okay.
 I somewhat expected this.
 The bleeding's stopped anywhere
 that the fleas only scratched me.
 They must secrete some chemical that
 stops blood from clotting naturally.
 If I start bleeding in too many
 places, I'll be in trouble.
 I can't let him escape!
 This is perfect.
 I can see clearly in every direction.
 How do you like this?
 There's nowhere for you to hide!
 Bring it on!
 Wait!
 This desert is massive.
 If you don't have any water,
 you'll die of thirst in a day.
 Too bad...
 I wanted to observe you a little longer,
 but I guess that won't work.
 I was running low on stamina, anyway.
 I suppose this gives us more
 time to talk things over...
 Let's begin with introductions.
 My name is Jail...
 Scratch that, it's Meleoron.
 When the Queen was still alive,
 I was a Squadron Leader.
 Nice to meet you.
 What's your name?
 Why were you following me?
 Because I didn't want to let you get away.
 And I certainly couldn't let you die...
 Because you'll be a valuable partner.
 You have business with the King, right?
 I do not!
 Huh?
 That was dangerous...
 He must have a reason for approaching me.
 I can't tell him anything.
 Really? Aren't you guys here to defeat the King?
 ""You guys""?
 Yep... I've been watching you since
 that other kid was with you.
 I understand.
 And you felt that I would put up
 less of a fight than Killua!
 Huh? Eh?!
 You've got it all wrong!
 That's how you interpret it?
 I guess it makes sense...
 To you, I'd look like an enemy.
 I guess I should clear up the misunderstanding first.
 Listen up.
 I swear that I'm not lying.
 I'm not looking to trick or defeat you!
 Okay, I believe you.
 Of course... It's hard to believe!
 I can sympathize.
 If I were in your shoes...
 Eh?
 Is that him?
 This is a trap.
 You still wanna come?
 Couldn't care less.
 Die.
 He instantly acted to kill me...
 No hesitation at all.
 I'm impressed!
 An underground lake?
 Lookin' for a taste of hell?
 Here you go!
 Blood!
 Food!
 It's food!
 Wait, this is...
 Captain Ikalgo's host!
 Crap, stop eating it.
 I want to stop, but I can't...
 The blood is calling to us!
 Bastard!
 How dare you chop off my precious legs?!
 I couldn't let you drag me into the water.
 These suction cups saved me.
 Anyway, aren't you an octopus?
 Don't call me an octopus!
 Killua's opponent turns out to be Ikalgo,
 a parasitic Chimera Ant, resembling
 an octopus, that uses human hosts.
 Don't call me an octopus!
 Next time: Ikalgo x And x Lightning.
 What has eight legs and lives in the ocean?
 An octopus.

 Ikalgo x And x Lightning
 A mob of assassins attacks Killua after he
 and Gon split up to stop the selection.
 One of them is Ikalgo,
 an octopus Chimera Ant.
 Aren't you an octopus?
 Don't call me an octopus!
 See ya!
 I need to find a new host, or
 I can't charge up my next shot.
 I'll let the Ortho siblings take it from here.
 Yo, we meet again.
 So we do...
 Long time, no see!
 Ya know?
 Can I ask you something?
 Sure, go ahead!
 Why didn't you dive underwater to escape?
 You should have an advantage in the water.
 Don't tell me you can't swim.
 Uh, well...
 It's the blood, right?
 When they smell blood, your
 buddies in the water go berserk
 and attack the injured, no matter who it is.
 With those wounds, if you went in there,
 you'd be torn to shreds.
 Am I wrong?
 Uh, w-well...
 I suppose that's one way to...
 Ikalgo, did you finish off the kid?
 No, we're still fighting!
 Who are you talking to?
 I screwed up!
 Right, you all can communicate via telepathy.
 Talking to your boss? It's that guy
 who was flying over me, right?
 Wait, now look here...
 Uh, so...
 Hey, Ikalgo! Answer me!
 You could say that's what I might be doing...
 Yes! We're still fighting!
 Oh, sorry to interrupt you.
 Let me know if you learn anything.
 If he sees dozens of dragonflies
 flying around inside a cave,
 the enemy would get suspicious...
 I won't be able to send my
 Satellite Dragonflies inside.
 Let's make a deal, then.
 If you tell me about his power,
 I'll spare your life.
 You have ten seconds to answer.
 Eight seconds left.
 Six seconds.
 I wanted to be reborn a squid...
 I would've given anything to have
 been a Chiroteuthis imperator.
 Do you think octopi and squid are similar?
 If so, you're mistaken...
 Octopi are ugly.
 Squid are squidderific.
 I think they look divine!
 Two seconds.
 I won't betray a buddy!
 Yeah, I could see that in your eyes.
 I can only hope
 that in my next life, I'll be born a squid...
 Wh—
 Why?
 Because you're a cool guy.
 In different circumstances,
 we could've been friends.
 You lowered your guard!
 Didn't think fish could jump, eh?
 I'll crush you and the rock behind you!
 Come in, Ikalgo.
 Y-Yes, the fight isn't over yet!
 Has he used any weapons or special abilities?
 Ikalgo!
 No, he's been fighting...
 with only his bare hands.
 Come on... Beg for your life.
 Otherwise, it's no fun!
 Or are you in too much pain to talk?
 Yeah, this is a relief.
 Huh?
 Fighting scumbags like you is a lot easier.
 Huh?
 I have no qualms about killing you.
 Yep! He was just a scumbag!
 That's why he was the decoy!
 I did it, Ortho-sama!
 I've attached the badge!
 Coburn pulled it off!
 Time to start the game.
 Let's enjoy ourselves.
 Damn, the bleeding won't stop...
 I need to find an exit.
 A digital sound inside my head?
 Wha—
 What?
 A fish? But I'm not in the water!
 What's going on?
 I didn't sense anything!
 Again...
 I didn't see anything or sense any
 aura until the fish hit me!
 What's going on?
 This is bad.
 I can't tell where the attacks are coming from.
 108 points.
 You have no idea what's going on?
 I should say that you're
 hearing my voice in your head.
 Well, if you survive long enough,
 you'll figure out what's happening.
 These are fish made from Nen.
 So why can't I sense them?
 Something must be triggering
 them from somewhere else.
 That's the only possible explanation!
 How else could I be attacked by
 something I can't see or sense?
 This is going well...
 Well, have you determined
 anything about these attacks?
 Three...
 He can only materialize three fish at once.
 After that, the fish will disappear.
 And the vivid colors of the
 target he put on me...
 It can only mean one thing!
 Your power involves
 darts!
 Bingo.
 That's correct.
 But the great thing about our power
 is that figuring it out won't help you.
 Because my Nen fish darts
 have no physical form until the
 instant they pierce your flesh.
 That makes it impossible to block them.
 Incidentally, your left shoulder is 54 points.
 I have a dart board
 that's linked to various parts of your body.
 For instance...
 Your right elbow is 27 points.
 Your right hand is 18 points.
 99 points...
 Hey, what's wrong?
 I can't hear your screams.
 Are you already dead?
 The game's only just begun.
 Triple 6!
 4!
 13!
 Bravo!
 Brother, that was magnificent.
 You're on a roll.
 Naturally...
 Our lives are on the line...
 This is how the Ortho siblings' power works.
 The sister creates a Nen badge,
 which activates after it's affixed to the target.
 That links the target to the dart
 board created by the brother.
 Until the game ends, no one
 can deactivate the badge,
 not even the Ortho Siblings.
 When the brother's darts hit the board,
 the target is attacked by needlefish.
 There is no way to avoid this attack.
 That is because, until they've
 hit the target's body,
 the needlefish do not exist.
 Thus, it is impossible to sense
 them coming or dodge them.
 This is our unbeatable power...
 Needlefish De Darts!
 Death Games
 Death Games
 Needlefish De Darts
 Of course, the siblings incur some risk.
 Once the badge activates, they are invincible.
 But if the brother misses the board with the
 final dart that decides the game's outcome,
 all of the damage the target has taken
 will transfer to the siblings.
 We are invincible. That is because...
 We are bound by the
 strongest trust in the world.
 It isn't over yet...
 Well, it seems the game's almost over.
 Why don't you tell him that?
 No need to be that nice.
 If he were pleading for his life,
 it'd be easier for me to focus.
 Or if he were to give up
 and beg me to kill him,
 or if he wanted to be a nihilistic hero
 and said, ""Not a bad way to die.""
 Those would help motivate me,
 as I toss my darts.
 But he'll just have to dread his impending
 death, never knowing when it will end...
 Until he dies.
 It's not...
 It's not over yet!
 Damn...
 This looks pretty bad...
 I've lost way too much blood.
 I could die here,
 so no point in saving what's left.
 Now, then.
 It's my final turn.
 Left ear.
 That sure gave him a big earring.
 Right calf!
 Okay, time for the last throw.
 My brother, I trust you.
 I've got this.
 See?
 Bravo!
 Yay!
 Yay!
 Yay!
 You're the best in the world!
 I'll go check his corpse.
 I'll come with you.
 We should share some of the
 meat with Coburn as a reward.
 Aren't you gonna eat?
 Can I ask you something?
 What?
 What made you decide to trust me?
 It wasn't that I didn't trust you.
 I just didn't know why you were following me.
 And you swore that you weren't lying.
 Huh?! That's it?
 Isn't that enough?
 Hell, no!
 Liars make promises all the time!
 A promise is the one thing
 you should never trust!
 Then you were lying?
 I'm different...
 I don't lie!
 I only tell the truth!
 Then it's okay.
 I think I'm starting to lose it.
 He's strong, but he's just a kid.
 I'm putting my fate in the
 hands of this clueless boy?
 Besides, if you're lying, that'll
 actually make things easier for me.
 Easier?
 I won't have to show you any mercy.
 I'll be free to destroy you.
 The look... The look in the kid's eyes...
 Yes, this is why I had a hunch...
 There's something special about this kid.
 I can't even tell how much
 power he really has...
 You hit him right in the forehead.
 Flutter-sama, we've taken out the target.
 Really? That's excellent.
 I will tell Leol-sama that a
 promotion is in order.
 Thank you very much.
 Great!
 We can be assistant squadron leaders now!
 Yay!
 Yay!
 Yay!
 H-How?
 How can you be alive with a dart
 sticking out of your brain?!
 What?
 It's a suction cup from an octopus.
 No way.
 How did you manage that trick?
 No, wait...
 My... My darts were perfect!
 It's absolutely impossible to stop them!
 Yeah, I didn't stop it.
 I just grabbed it,
 the moment it materialized at my head.
 From what you were saying, I could tell
 you could hear my voice,
 but you couldn't see me.
 I had plenty of time to switch out
 the needle for a suction cup.
 H-Hold on...
 No human has reflexes fast
 enough to catch a dart!
 Well, it wouldn't have been possible had
 I not known where it would appear.
 But I knew exactly where and
 when the last dart would hit.
 The final dart must hit the board's
 outer ring per double out rules.
 And you were playing an 01—501 game.
 You start with 501 points,
 and the goal is to reach 0.
 These rules are used in professional competition.
 I n-never told you what rules I was using!
 As soon as I knew you were playing darts,
 my suspicions were confirmed.
 Remember how
 your first dart hit double 4?
 The game starts by hitting the board's outer ring.
 A double in...
 A sign that you were confident in your skill.
 A skilled player would play by official rules.
 Players with talent and confidence
 tend to seek public recognition.
 After that, I just had to do the
 math and endure the pain.
 I subtracted your points from 501,
 and waited until your score was under 40.
 At that point,
 I placed my hand in the 40-point area, my forehead.
 That's all it took.
 To improve his reflexes, Killua changed
 his aura into electricity.
 When the dart touched his skin,
 the sensation did not travel
 from his skin to his brain
 using the nervous system.
 He used Nen to ensure that, as soon
 as the aura registered the dart,
 it sent a message directly to his
 left hand, to grab the dart.
 Do you have some history with darts?
 At age six, I mastered the game.
 I've counted down from 1,440 points.
 It was part of my early training.
 It's your fault for getting cocky
 and talking too much!
 Or was I seven?
 You're so stupid!
 Guess it doesn't matter...
 Pipe down! You just stood around and clapped!
 I talked too long.
 I need to hurry!
 Huh?
 What?
 My body won't do what I tell it to...
 Wait, is this really happening?
 Wow...
 All this is my blood?
 It feels like I'm taking a warm bath.
 Wait, this isn't the time to think about that...
 I should get going.
 Crap... Now I feel cold...
 Damn...
 And after that last fight gave me a hint...
 for improving my power.
 Am I...
 going to die here?
 Gon... Sorry...
 I wasn't any... help...
 Octopus...
 Don't call me an octopus!
 What are you doing?
 Isn't that obvious?
 I'm turning traitor.
 Lame, huh?
 Now stop talking.
 I know a secret doctor.
 It won't take long by underground waterway.
 Don't die before we get there!
 Are you an idiot?
 I spared... your life...
 Now they'll be hunting you...
 I know that!
 Don't ask me why I'm doing this.
 But you know...
 After you told me, an octopus,
 that I was a cool guy...
 After you said we could be friends...
 I couldn't let you die!
 I'm gonna save you!

 While Killua was being rescued
 by the Chimera Ant Ikalgo,
 his supposed enemy,
 Gon, too, was forming a bond with
 a Chimera Ant called Meleoron.
 You should stop smoking.
 If the smoke sticks to you,
 people can smell you coming, and it'll
 waste your ability to become invisible.
 I appreciate the warning.
 But honestly, that doesn't matter.
 While my invisibility is a sort of calling card,
 my real power is on an entirely different level.
 Just watch.
 Huh?! He vanished in an instant...
 I can't sense him at all.
 Only the smell of cigarettes.
 He's gone...
 This isn't mere invisibility.
 Does he also have the ability
 to change locations instantly,
 without making any sound?
 That isn't possible!
 How did he do it?!
 Where'd you come from?
 I've been here the entire time.
 Huh?

 When I hold my breath,
 no one can sense my existence.
 You were even touching me...
 But your mind didn't realize it.
 Eh? I touched you?
 You know how some people are easily overlooked?
 When you go to a restaurant in a group,
 there's always one person that the
 waitress forgets to bring water.
 This is an extreme version.
 I'm right here, but no one notices me.
 Oh...
 I use my other ability to turn invisible
 to cover this one so no one can learn about it.
 For the record, you and I are
 the only ones in the world
 who know this.
 Why tell me something so important?
 Well, it's to build trust.
 Since I'm the one who has to take a risk...
 If I can't convince you to trust me,
 we can't start anything.
 You mean, what you said about
 me being a valuable partner?
 Yeah, but that's for later.
 Like I said, we have to trust each other first.
 Once you've agreed to be my
 partner, I'll tell you more.
 Okay, I'll be your partner.
 That was fast!
 You don't know how to bargain, kid.
 Don't be so trusting of me!
 Suspect everyone!
 Until you've done due diligence,
 don't trust anyone!
 Huh?
 I said it's okay, so why are
 you being so difficult?
 Can you even make this decision on your own?!
 What about your buddy?
 He'll have a fit
 when he hears you teamed up with
 a suspicious-looking monster...
 And why am I insulting myself?
 I didn't choose to be this way!
 He talks a lot...
 Whatever.
 Even a friend of twenty years
 could stab you in the back.
 Time is no measure of trust!
 Say, ""Ho""!
 You're no fun...
 We can never be friends.
 I feel the same way...
 Then, are you sure about this?
 About what?
 About teaming up with me.
 Won't your buddy object?
 Most likely.
 Because he tends to be cautious
 and to question everything.
 This won't work, then.
 The deal's dead in the water.
 But if I insist on having my way, it'll be fine.
 Killua won't like it, but he'll give in.
 Really... He must have a hard time.
 Well, whatever.
 If you say it's okay, I'll trust you.
 So let's get to business.
 Yeah.
 I want to defeat the King.
 Want to know why?
 Yeah, of course.
 That's what I've been waiting for...
 Revenge.
 Right now, I can't tell you
 why I want revenge...
 Okay.
 I'd like to know, but I'll wait.
 That's probably what he wants to hear...
 If you're that curious, I'll tell you.
 You'll tell me now?!
 Just kidding!
 Beg all you want, but I won't tell you now.
 I didn't beg you for anything.
 The King killed someone I owed my life to.
 His name was Peggy.
 I saw the King behead him right before my eyes.
 But at the time, I didn't realize
 what had happened.
 Huh? Why not?
 You saw it happen, didn't you?
 Because I'd forgotten that Peggy
 was the one who raised me.
 A little while ago, I began to recover my
 memories from when I was human.
 I haven't remembered everything.
 No, I should rephrase that...
 I've only remembered a few things.
 The names of my parents, my name,
 episodes from my childhood.
 Peggy was the name of the
 Chimera Ant the King killed.
 That was also my foster father's human name.
 He was into education, and always
 carried thick books around.
 In both life and death, he never
 parted with his books about NGL.
 Then you all have memories
 from when you were human?
 I don't know if we're all the same.
 Some Chimera Ants are clearly feral in nature.
 With others, there's no
 telling what they're thinking.
 But I think I understand now.
 This is why, when we first met,
 I was willing to trust you.
 You're very human.
 More human than any other
 Chimera Ant I've met.
 In fact, I'd say you're still human.
 Really? When I met you,
 I had the opposite reaction.
 Huh?
 I could sense a vicious beast inside you.
 That's why I wanted to team up.
 There's no limit to what you'll do.
 All right... Now, let's get down to business.
 But first, could you tell me your name?
 I'm Gon... Gon Freecss.
 I actually have one more ability.
 And the condition for its
 activation has been met.
 Time to show you my third power!
 Activate!
 It isn't flying away...
 Does that mean I was using Perfect Plan, too?
 Exactly.
 This is my third power, God's Accomplice.
 While Perfect Plan is active, it allows
 anyone I touch to use it, as well.
 Do you understand how powerful
 this technique is now?
 This power will let us approach
 and attack the enemy...
 without their knowledge.
 The King's strength doesn't matter...
 If we can sneak up and use a powerful
 attack when his guard is lowered, we'll win.
 Hey, Gon...
 You're the partner I've been looking for.
 The perfect guy to smack the King
 with the strongest attack this world's ever seen!
 I was watching
 when you used that rock-paper-scissors thing.
 Those were my soldiers.
 I sent them to attack, so I could
 measure your strength,
 but they...
 Ah, no need to feel bad...
 They were killing for sport when
 I wasn't paying attention.
 They're no longer my soldiers, or even my allies.
 Well, from their perspective,
 I'm the one who's changed.
 What you said about being your partner...
 There's someone who'd be better than me.
 You know someone?
 Yep.
 I'll contact him.
 Hold on.
 I trust you.
 And even if you end up turning on me,
 I won't blame you or regret my decision.
 Because I watched you, spoke to you,
 and decided to trust you.
 But I'm not about to trust others
 just because you trust them.
 Do you understand?
 I get your point, but...
 My life is on the line here.
 Listen to me.
 Perfect Plan is not invincible.
 In fact, it's highly vulnerable.
 I can make people ignore my existence,
 but I'm still right there in the same place.
 They just don't notice me.
 So their attacks can still hit me.
 Knowing there's a person around with
 my ability, what would someone do?
 They'd launch attacks in every direction.
 Oh, you're right...
 If one of those attacks hits me,
 even by dumb luck, I'm done for.
 I hate to admit it,
 but when it comes to combat,
 I'm the weakest Chimera Ant around.
 I'm on the same level as foot soldiers.
 Forget the King...
 I couldn't even survive a punch
 from a Squadron Leader.
 If I just turn invisible,
 others can locate me with En.
 It's been tested, so the other
 Squadron Leaders know this, too.
 I need my enemies to believe
 my power to be weak.
 They need to think En is enough to beat it.
 This ability is only invincible
 if no one knows about it.
 Enough explaining...
 My point is that I don't want to
 reveal my power to any others!
 Not even if it's someone you trust.
 You can see for yourself, then.
 I'll call him out here without mentioning you.
 W-Wait...
 You can watch from a distance.
 Helloâ€”
 Yo! I've been waiting, fool!
 You pulled a fast one! Where are you?
 I've got lots of questions for you.
 Because of you kids, the boss
 had to make a move...
 The plan's been derailed,
 but I support what you're doing.
 Letting five million die isn't right.
 The boss used his power to surround the capital.
 Really?
 That should make it harder for Neferpitou
 to control puppets remotely.
 In other words, they can't perform
 the selection from a distance.
 Right.
 But the boss and Knov-san will be expending
 all their energy to delay Neferpitou.
 Which means, when the operation starts,
 they won't be in any condition to
 take on any of the Royal Guard.
 We expect more citizens to gather
 in the capital for the celebration.
 There may be a massacre yet.
 The situation's still grim...
 We can no longer contact the Chairman.
 He's holed up somewhere until the last
 possible minute, preparing for the final battle.
 We four need to make a decision.
 Do we summon reinforcements, or do we
 face the three Royal Guards by ourselves?
 I'd like to know Killua's opinion.
 He isn't here.
 What? You split up?
 I get it... He's been disrupting things alone.
 Can you call him real quick?
 No luck. He isn't picking up...
 I think his is off.
 Really? Well, keep trying.
 We should meet up, the sooner the better.
 Yeah.
 Let's find a halfway point to meet.
 Here... Mandai City.
 Okay, got it.
 Checkmate.
 You're done.
 Why didn't you resign?
 Don't make me repeat myself.
 The match ended twenty-two moves ago.
 Why did you not resign then?
 Did you believe I would make a mistake?
 Idiot.
 Next, we have the national Go champion.
 Give me the rulebook.
 It may look simple at first,
 but it is a complex game.
 It may take more time to learn than shogi.
 Please let me leave!
 What do you want?
 Someone! Help me!
 My glasses...
 Silence.
 You are in the King's presence.
 The choice is yours.
 Sit across from me now.
 Or die.
 5.5 points.
 The King wins.
 I-It only took him ten games?
 I'm t-tired!
 It's the only explanation for that loss!
 And I think I have a fever.
 I'm short on sleep.
 And I feel dizzy...
 I'll give you eight hours.
 And any medicine you need.
 I expect you to be in top condition.
 Should you lose again, I won't
 be interested in excuses.
 Rest as if your life depends on it.
 I'm impressed by how quickly
 you learn these games.
 I can't believe it took less than half
 the time you spent mastering shogi.
 It's all about learning the feel.
 Chess, Go, shogi...
 They have different rules, but all three
 have a certain rhythm to their moves.
 That means disrupting your
 opponent's rhythm is crucial.
 Once you've learned the openings,
 you can deduce your opponent's rhythm.
 Once you know their rhythm,
 you need only disrupt it.
 A psychological principle that
 would apply to any contest.
 If you've already reached that conclusion,
 I don't see the benefit of playing more games.
 I believe they will only bore you.
 How many remain?
 This country has one more professional game.
 It's a board game called Gungi.
 Gungi?
 The game originated in East Gorteau,
 and nearly all citizens know how to play.
 Give me the rulebook.
 As in chess and shogi, its goal is to trap the king.
 But you can stack up to three pieces.
 At the start, you may also freely place
 your pieces within your own area.
 The game has a different feel
 due to the addition of a third dimension.
 For the past fifteen years,
 there have been world tournaments,
 and East Gorteau has yet to lose.
 Currently, they're on their third representative,
 a five-time reigning champion.
 Then, if I defeat this champion,
 I'll be the best in the world?
 A fitting way to end this recreation.
 Bring them in.
 There are six days until the selection.
 The King has no idea
 how this girl is about to influence his fate.
 Next time: Check x And x Mate.
 I'm Gon.
 I'm Gillua.
 Did you change your name?
 No way.
 Say it again.
 I'm Gillua!
 GG!

 Six days remain before
 Neferpitou begins the selection.
 The King has spent this time in his palace,
 defeating the masters of shogi,
 Go, and other board games.
 The last remaining one,
 the reigning Gungi world champion,
 has just been summoned to his side.
 U-Um...
 Th-Thank you for infighting me—
 For inciting me...
 No need for small talk.
 You and I will play Gungi.
 Right now, I am learning the
 rules, so you must wait.
 Huh? You don't sound like the Supreme Leader.
 He's dead.
 Now I am the King.
 I'm s-so sorry!
 Please forgive me!
 I'm only a fool, one who knows
 nothing of the outside world!
 I can't even talk normally...
 You are distracting me. Be silent.
 Or I'll kill you.
 Okay, I basically understand.
 Let us begin.
 What's wrong?
 It appears she's passed out.
 After you told her to be quiet,
 she shut her mouth...
 Then, since her nose was stuffed up,
 it seems she was unable to breathe.
 This is an uncommonly stupid girl.
 Yeah, that was embarrassing!
 I can't even do things a baby can.
 My parents are always yelling at me...
 Just play the game.
 Yes!
 I'm honored to play against you.
 You can see with your eyes?
 No, I can't see a thing.
 So would you please tell me your moves?
 I only open them when I play.
 If it bothers you, I can try to close them...
 I don't care.
 The atmosphere has changed.
 4-4-1, pawn.
 You can't reach him at all?
 No, I guess his phone is off.
 We agreed that he would initiate all contact,
 so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
 Damn, then we have to wait for him to call?
 Why does that guy look like he
 was born in the wrong decade?
 And the look on his face says
 he's always looking for a fight...
 The other has no eyebrows,
 and that expression makes it
 clear that he trusts no one.
 It's not even a question of
 whether he and I can get along.
 I can already see he won't believe a word I say.
 Gon, I'm sorry to say that my
 first impression is very bad!
 Unless I get some really good news soon,
 there's no way I'll be able to trust them.
 I guarantee it.
 Hey, what's all this?
 Beats me. Just a pack of strays, I guess.
 They have collars...
 He's been feeding all the animals
 left behind due to the selection.
 He's even sacrificed sleep...
 I'm not feeding all of them!
 I know we don't have time to waste on that!
 So I abandoned those that stood no chance.
 That's efficient, yeah?
 Some were just skin and bones,
 but still wouldn't take my food.
 Some were so loyal, they wouldn't leave
 their homes after I untied them...
 What's so bad about saving
 the ones that want the help?!
 You don't have to cry about it.
 I'm n-not crying, fool!
 Want me to smack you?
 That won't be enough to raise my opinion.
 Well, he certainly is different, though.
 7-8-2, spy.
 Checkmate.
 She's using an orthodox approach,
 stacking archers on her pawns.
 A standard strategy.
 Textbook execution.
 And her initial placement
 is one used with beginners.
 Meaning that I am not good enough
 for her to show her true skill.
 Another game.
 Yes, absolutely!
 8-8-1, knight.
 I guess that's checkmate.
 You're such a fast learner, Supreme Leader.
 I'll have to step up my game,
 or you'll get the jump on me!
 That's enough... Go get some rest.
 That isn't necessary... I'm just fine.
 I can play Gungi for three days
 and nights without sleep!
 I have another guest.
 Once I've finished with him, it'll be your turn.
 Then I'll get a little rest.
 What do you think?
 It's but a matter of time.
 There are more options to choose from,
 but essentially, this game is
 no different than the rest.
 In four or five more games, she will
 have to use her real ability.
 Once that happens, I shall be
 able to observe her rhythm.
 Nothing has changed.
 Your Majesty,
 the Go player hanged himself.
 Bring that idiot back.
 While the King continues to play
 against the Gungi master,
 a short distance away, Morel has
 been using his power to surround
 the capital city of Peijing.
 Purple Haze Soldiers
 Deep Purple
 Deep Purple.
 First, he releases the aura that serves as a core.
 He then envelops it in an aura haze,
 creating a smoke puppet that he can
 control at will via the Nen within the core.
 His ability can sustain two hundred
 and sixteen puppets at once.
 On the chance that the enemy retaliates,
 I've made my soldiers more responsive,
 so I can only maintain fifty now.
 But they're much stronger.
 One advantage is that En can't differentiate
 between one of these and a human.
 But at heart, Chimera Ants are still ants.
 So Neferpitou won't leave the King's side.
 As expected, Neferpitou has recalled
 the controlled humans to the capital
 to take up defensive positions.
 That implies the King's safety is top priority.
 Which means that restricting the movement
 of the Royal Guard is very easy.
 However, the question is how the King will respond.
 If we're dealing with a King who does as he
 likes, it'll be harder to anticipate him.
 And the risk of miscalculation increases.
 But as long as they keep
 these coming, we're fine.
 Long time, no see.
 I've been looking for you.
 Bah, he's gotten stronger.
 The air about him feels totally different.
 Knuckle's APR is gone?
 It doesn't appear to have become IRS, either.
 If something had happened,
 Knuckle's group would have contacted me.
 If APR is gone,
 they have someone who can dispel Nen.
 Or did he do it himself?
 Let's see what they can do.
 Whichever wins...
 In the end,
 I will triumph.
 Time to return the favor.
 First, I'll beat you down.
 Then it's the pompadour's turn.
 His confidence is far from baseless.
 He must have gained a new ability.
 I wouldn't be so certain!
 If that ability is to exorcise Nen,
 we're in trouble.
 Knuckle and Shoot both use
 hit-and-fade fighting styles.
 Shoot does what he can to support
 Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.
 But we can't nullify their Nen with ours
 if they have someone who can dispel it.
 A strategy that might have worked
 against the King is useless now.
 However...
 if he has the ability to exorcise Nen,
 this is a good opportunity.
 If I neutralize him here, Knuckle
 and Shoot can use their powers.
 I must fight...
 I can't drop Deep Purple, so I'll have
 to get by on my remaining aura.
 What?
 He's still relying on speed?
 There are plenty of ways to deal with
 someone who only uses speed.
 Now you're ""It.""
 Huh? What was that?
 Wh-Where am I?
 A savannah?
 Did he teleport me?
 If this is his new ability,
 a different Chimera Ant is the Nen exorcist.
 That's bad.
 Sure you should just be standing around?
 It's time to start
 this game of tag.
 Tag?
 We're in a field that I created.
 Unless you touch me, you can't leave.
 Your time limit is eight hours.
 Let's start!
 Hey!
 Didn't you hear what I said?
 You can't leave without touching me!
 If I chase you, I'll never catch you.
 So I'm going to take my time.
 Morel disappeared with the enemy!
 Cheetu has activated his power...
 I don't know what it does, but they
 won't be back for eight hours.
 The scenery is just a wall.
 Looks like I'm in some kind of space
 separated from the real world, like he said.
 Seems to be about the size of a baseball field.
 If I stopped Deep Purple, I could
 break out of here with ease.
 However...
 First, is it even possible for me to stop
 Deep Purple from within this space?
 Second, if I'm able to stop it,
 will that aura return to me here, in this space?
 The worst scenario would be one
 in which I stop Deep Purple,
 but the aura can't reach me in this space.
 Once Deep Purple is halted,
 it can't be reactivated until
 I've recovered the aura.
 It's too risky to try.
 I can't stop Deep Purple.
 At least, not yet.
 Are you finally ready to start?
 This way! Follow my lead!
 Hold on, you aren't gonna...
 You bet I am!
 It's a waste of time.
 You can't destroy the walls or the hourglass.
 There's only one way out.
 And that's to catch me.
 I can tell that
 Knuckle's Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
 has weakened his power...
 So then...
 Hey, what happens if I don't touch
 you within the time limit?
 Who knows?
 I have no obligation to answer that question.
 Naturally, of course not.
 It appears there's more to this ability.
 I'm in for the long haul, then.
 Wake me up in five hours.
 Are you mocking me?
 Go ahead, lose your temper.
 It seems you don't understand your own power.
 This isn't a battle of speed.
 It's a battle of mental fortitude.
 Deep Purple is still active...
 So the operation continues.
 Leol-sama, I've discovered another enemy.
 It's a man in a suit, with black hair and glasses.
 Anyone else around?
 No, just the figures in white.
 Those white figures are probably ordinary soldiers.
 But it's possible that the true leader
 is concealed among them.
 And I can't let anyone see my power.
 And Hirin is occupied with
 exorcising the Nen on Cheetu...
 Damn...
 I need at least two more pawns!
 Okay, but in return, you have to defeat him.
 The King is nearly finished playing games.
 After that, the King will insist on
 defeating his enemies himself.
 We will be there to guard him, but
 you never know what might happen...
 We would rather the King remain
 inside until the selection is over.
 Do you need something?
 Give Leol a hand.
 Yes, as you wish.
 Well?
 I am becoming worried.
 They've played many times, but
 the King is nowhere near victory.
 This player is a true master...
 I should have been able to break
 her defenses from the left side.
 But she used a peculiar move
 sequence to turn the tables.
 4-5-1, musketeer.
 2-8-2, fortress.
 What?
 The spy has done nothing this entire match...
 But suddenly, it controls the board!
 My right side's been destroyed.
 I'm done. That's checkmate.
 Impossible.
 From start to checkmate, there were
 one hundred, forty-four moves.
 This outcome could have only happened
 if she foresaw each of my moves.
 On to the next game.
 Yes!
 This is utterly impossible!
 A storm is brewing.
 The girl's strength upsets the King.
 And a storm draws near the palace.
 Next time: Doubt x And x Hesitation.
 Please go easy on us.
 Clack.
 Whack.
 Whoosh.
 Clang.
 Checkmate.

104,"How many are there?
 Around five thousand.
 And that's a fifth of what they were expecting.
 The King must be angry about that.
 No...
 Apparently, he's been playing games in his room.
 He's so obsessed with Gungi,
 he's been skipping meals.
 Then what about all this food?
 Should we take it for ourselves?
 You want to take on the King
 and his Royal Guard?
 Don't make me laugh.
 Yeah...
 Sometimes, you can't see how strong someone
 is until you have enough strength yourself.
 They're monsters. I'll do as they say.
 When Shaia-dono gave us our powers,
 he'd probably anticipated that
 things would turn out this way.
 Hagya's the only one who doesn't get it!
 If you call him by his old name, he gets mad.
 Doubt x And x Hesitation
 The suit with the glasses is keeping
 a careful watch on his surroundings
 while heading toward the palace.
 The puppets are useless against him.
 He's strong.
 What about his abilities?
 Like the others, he has used
 only physical attacks thus far.
 Okay, let me know if he shows his power.
 Once Welfin and Brovada arrive,
 we'll take care of those figures in white.
 I can also check out the
 powers those two have.
 Damn, I lost sight of him!
 Leol-sama, it appears that the suit
 with glasses is able to teleport.
 Knov's ability is called Hide and Seek.
 Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex
 Hide and Seek
 It allows him to teleport.
 By placing a hand against a wall or the ground,
 he can open a portal to access Nen space.
 He is able to transport people
 and objects through that portal.
 Hide and Seek creates a Nen space of
 twenty-one rooms, on four floors.
 Each room is isolated.
 The entrance shuts when anyone enters,
 so to return to the real world,
 one must exit by a different door.
 It is possible to create multiple entrances.
 The number of possible entrances differs
 depending on the size of the room.
 The exit leads back to the portal used for entry.
 So, as a general rule, one can only enter
 and exit via the location of the entry portal.
 However, using Knov's master key,
 an exit can be linked to any portal.
 Nothing out of place.
 Still quiet on the battlefront.
 Morel's Deep Purple is used for
 primarily defensive purposes.
 If a puppet encounters someone who
 isn't an ally, it will keep its distance.
 If it comes under attack, it will
 retreat, while fighting back.
 The puppets fight back by throwing
 nearby objects at the enemy.
 They avoid direct contact,
 so the enemy won't realize
 they are Nen puppets.
 That's a Chimera...
 What is it doing?
 We're pretty far from the battlefield.
 Is it scouting the area?
 There were strange dragonflies around town.
 I thought they were a local species,
 but might they be created from his Nen?
 It's very likely...
 If it's a Chimera Ant that specializes in
 gathering intel, I must neutralize it quickly!
 The battle is on.
 Hey... Hey!
 Aren't you gonna touch me?
 Look how close I am...
 I know you're awake.
 Whoa, there!
 I knew you were faking it.
 You can't trick me!
 With you being so noisy, I can't fall asleep!
 Give me some peace and quiet!
 No way!
 I won't let you get any sleep!
 I'll keep making noise until you chase me!
 Idiot...
 If that's what you wanted,
 you should have set a rule
 to force people to keep chasing you.
 Looks like he's still getting
 used to his new power...
 Have it your way.
 I won't be getting up for the next five hours.
 He's really focused on making
 this a contest of speed.
 Coupled with his constant need for attention,
 it's unlikely that he'll settle for
 any other type of contest.
 I'm not gonna let you sleep!
 Hey! Over here!
 I'm within reach...
 Get up!
 Look how close I am.
 It's just a waiting game.
 If he gives up and moves away...
 I win.

 1-5-1, marshal.

 2-3-1, pawn.
 8-1-1, spy.

 2-7-2, musketeer.
 The marshal has been isolated...
 I'll call this ""remote concealment.""

 1-6-2, general.
 9-1-3, archer.
 3-2-2, major general.
 I'm done.
 Her initial placement was exactly as expected.
 She's shifting toward my marshal
 without breaking her crane formation.
 Let us begin, then.
 Her first move will be to position
 her archer on her right flank.
 She'll probably try a three-pronged
 attack to end it quickly.
 But shifting her pieces to the right
 exposes her left flank to attack.
 It's time to disrupt your rhythm.
 1-9-3, new archer.
 There it is.
 9-7-1, new spy.
 2-9-1, knight.
 Her three-pronged attack
 and left flank movement
 will cost me two pieces.
 But that created an opening in her left flank.
 She'll probably expect me to
 go all-in from that side.
 But I won't!
 Here it is!
 5-5-1, lieutenant general.
 Each of her moves has followed
 a set rhythm until just now,
 when she froze.
 Given the current placement,
 I can attack through the
 center in unlimited ways.
 There is no best move.
 With every turn, I have the
 ability to extend the match.
 Now, let me hear you
 squeal!
 9-2-1, new lieutenant general.
 That's checkmate.
 You knew my strategy was a dead end.
 Dead End
 Yes.
 Why did you need to think
 before making your move?
 You could have made that move at once.
 The King has moved this match off the board.
 A wrong answer could mean
 her death.
 Your ""remote concealment"" strategy
 is actually named ""kokoriko.""
 I came up with that strategy...
 ten years ago.
 Placing the lieutenant general in the center
 to counter a three-pronged attack is also a
 move I devised, called ""general in the middle.""
 At the time, both drew a lot of attention.
 Moving from kokoriko to general in the middle
 was a popular transition that tested
 both players' ability to read their opponents.
 I was pretty happy
 that a fool like me could figure
 out a smart strategy...
 But then, I saw how to defeat it.
 A year after I came up with kokoriko,
 an opponent used it against me
 in the national tournament,
 and I figured out how to counter it.
 I won the match,
 but the strategy disappeared from
 official matches and textbooks.
 That the Supreme Leader thought
 of the same strategy as I had...
 I was so honored, and touched...
 My heart trembled.
 It felt like...
 Like seeing my child brought back to life.
 That was how it felt.
 So it was difficult for me
 to take that life again.
 That was why
 I hesitated.
 Foolishness.
 I've had enough.
 Get some rest.
 Once we begin again,
 you won't get any more breaks.
 Be prepared!
 Y-Yes...
 I believe this is
 the first time the King has ever listened
 to anyone speak for such a long time.
 Well,
 it should have no significance...
 Four hours have passed?
 He got bored and started reading...
 That guy's too easy to understand.
 Oh, you're ready to start?
 Has it already been five hours?
 Wait, it's only half full.
 Are you getting worried?
 You just noticed?
 We aren't starting now.
 It's already over.
 Look at your ankle.
 A rope of smoke?
 That took a lot of effort...
 I had to go all the way around
 so you wouldn't notice,
 so it turned into quite a long rope.
 In any case, all that's left
 is to wind up the rope.
 Now it's only a matter of time.
 Your turn to try whatever you can.
 But it won't work.
 You should take the smoke seriously.
 Essentially, it's a rope that can't be severed.
 You can struggle all you want.
 I knew it...
 He won't attack me because
 this is a game of tag.
 If I touch his body, it will break his ability.
 He has no patience, but he chose
 for the game to last eight hours.
 I'm not the one you're putting pressure on.
 The pressure's on you.
 Cheetu's power was still a work in progress.
 With his back against the wall,
 desperate for a way out...
 He created a new ability.
 A crossbow and claws.
 He can fight at any range.
 Thanks!
 You helped me gain an awesome new power!
 Hey, do you know what this is?
 It's a bow. A bow!
 You sure you want to come closer?!
 There!
 I'm quite sure.
 Why would you want a power
 that's slower than you are?
 Ah.
 Why don't you try those claws?
 Then I won't have to walk over.
 I'll tell you why you lost.
 It's because
 you're an idiot.
 Die!
 Then you can never touch me!
 This sensation...
 It can't be...
 Smoke?
 No way!
 Caught you.
 Wh-When did you...
 While you were reading manga
 and laughing like a fool,
 I created a copy of myself from smoke.
 And I covered myself with smoke
 that looked like grass.
 My copy went one way, and I went the other.
 The fight continues, even while one sleeps.
 You shouldn't have looked away.
 Looks like we're back...
 Well, do you still want to fight?
 No, I've had enough.
 That's a wise decision...
 Then why not tell me
 what would have happened
 if I hadn't caught you?
 There's no point in asking.
 Once I've been caught,
 I can't use that power anymore.
 That was the condition I set.
 Really? I feel bad...
 It's no big deal.
 I'll ask Shaia-sama for a new power!
 Next time, I won't lose.
 You'd better be ready!
 His superior
 is most likely a Royal Guard named Shaia,
 who has the power to release Nen skills.
 So if the selection is carried out,
 winning will become very difficult.
 Gon and Killua made the right choice.
 We need to meet.
 Let's talk inside.
 Reinforcements have arrived.
 It's a crayfish and a wolf.
 Are they strong?
 If I knew, my job would be easier...
 Right now, they're trying to gauge our strength.
 So it's currently a stalemate.
 Our goal is to buy time, so it all works out.
 I suspect it's because I took out this one.
 Those dragonflies were acting
 as security cameras.
 Come in, Flutter!
 Doesn't seem he's going to show.
 Change in plans!
 Without Flutter, we have no way
 to know the enemy's location.
 Damn.
 When it really counts, he lets me down!
 Should I call it off?
 No, I can't do that.
 I cannot lose face in front of Pitou again!
 We're heading back, then.
 Ah, hold on...
 It's okay. I'll find a way to handle it.
 Rental Pod
 IOU Dispenser
 Is that your power?
 Yeah, I can use it to scout around.
 Don't tell anyone else...
 I'm showing you because I trust you.
 Idiots, I wouldn't tell you the truth.
 Leol's Rental Pod allows him to temporarily
 borrow an ability in exchange
 for granting the target a favor.
 However, two conditions must be met.
 First,
 he must have seen the ability or know its name.
 Satellite Dragonflies
 Second, he must grant a favor.
 After confirming that his favor is not
 free and is expected to be repaid,
 this skill will activate, assuming
 the target agrees to his conditions.
 Got it!
 Once all conditions are met, Leol's
 dispenser automatically stores data,
 which can be checked at any time.
 However, if the target dies,
 the data will be deleted.
 Flutter's fine.
 I believe there's been no communication
 because he's unconscious or far away.
 A rental can be used for one hour.
 During the rental period, the target
 cannot use the borrowed power.
 Anyway, Flutter is still alive...
 Looks like we'll be able to stay in touch.
 Once Flutter's Satellite Dragonflies
 verify the location of the suit
 with the glasses, we'll start.
 So we keep the small fry at a distance
 while you take on the suit with the glasses.
 You gonna be okay on your own?
 Just trust me. I wouldn't give
 you a job you can't handle.
 And I don't want you to see my power.
 I'll do whatever it takes to
 complete this mission.
 Okay...
 I can't afford to wait around here.
 Not until the King is in my debt!
 When Leol takes the dispensed IOU and
 tears it up, the effect activates.
 They're here.
 Time to start scouting.
 I don't understand.
 This is upsetting.
 During our matches, I am the only
 one who's getting flustered.
 I would have expected this to be
 humiliating on a new level.
 But...
 At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.
 But I don't understand why...
 Next time: Resolve x And x Awakening.
 Morel-san, what's in your pipe?
 It holds...
 Gulp.
 ...tonkotsu.

105,"Your ""remote concealment"" strategy
 is actually named ""kokoriko.""
 I came up with that strategy...
 ten years ago.
 I was pretty happy
 that a fool like me could figure
 out a smart strategy...
 But then, I saw how to defeat it.
 That the Supreme Leader thought
 of the same strategy as I had...
 I was so honored and touched...
 My heart trembled.
 It felt like...
 Like seeing my child brought back to life.
 Foolishness.
 I've had enough.
 Get some rest.
 Once we begin again,
 you won't get any more breaks.
 Be prepared!
 Resolve x And x Awakening
 This is upsetting.
 During our matches, I am the only
 one who's getting flustered.
 I would have expected this to be
 humiliating on a new level.
 But...
 At the same time, I am enjoying our matches.
 But I don't understand why...
 That I do not understand my own mind
 upsets me more than words can describe!
 Did she not choose to rest?
 No...
 Unsightly.
 No sign of intelligence or dignity.
 How can such a being
 boast a Gungi record so stellar
 that it could be called
 the ultimate in game theory?
 Wake up! We're starting again.
 Y-Yes...
 9-5-1, marshal.
 For this match...
 Hmm?
 We should make a wager.
 A wager?
 Correct.
 If you win, I shall grant
 any wish you request.
 Any wish I request?
 Any wish...
 However...
 If you lose,
 I shall take your left arm.
 Fear and desire hold the power
 to disrupt one's rhythm.
 Desire clouds vision,
 while fear stills one's step.
 My left arm...
 My left arm...
 Should I do it?!
 Why do you hesitate?
 Well... Instead of my left arm...
 Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?
 What?
 What do you bet?
 My life.
 If I lose, I will offer you my life.
 But you might consider that an insult...
 I do not understand.
 Explain yourself.
 Um...
 Well, Gungi is really the only thing I can do.
 In other words, Gungi is the reason I'm alive.
 But professional Gungi players,
 even national champions, make but a pittance.
 Only after you become the world
 champion as representative for a nation
 will you receive any meaningful reward.
 To become the national representative,
 you must win tournaments.
 In other words, you cannot lose a single match.
 I come from a family of twelve,
 and in our home, I'm the breadwinner.
 If I lose a single match,
 I will become the greatest burden on my family.
 Gungi players have a saying...
 That, after losing once, a Gungi master
 becomes a normal person.
 If I lose,
 I'll be garbage.
 Ah, it doesn't bother me!
 It's just what my parents always said...
 So, the day I set my sights on
 becoming a professional player,
 I decided that if I ever lost a match,
 I would take my own life.
 But that could be a problem...
 How so?
 When I lose, I'll become garbage...
 And all you'd receive for
 winning would be garbage.
 That would be a terrible insult.
 It doesn't bother me.
 I'm more interested in learning
 what you'd want if you win.
 You see...
 I've spent all of my time thinking about Gungi...
 I'll think about it later, after I win.
 Very well.
 Then she possesses neither desire nor fear?
 Your life, was it?
 It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!
 I never imagined that, if you won,
 you might ask for my life.
 Your Majesty!
 Silence!
 The Supreme Leader's l-li—
 I w-would never ask such a thing!
 The thought never crossed my mind!
 I know that.
 The fault is my own.
 The wager is off.
 It was a petty tactic.
 No...
 Accept this apology.
 Your Majesty!
 How could you do that?
 I must treat your arm...
 Come with me!
 Y-Your arm?
 Continue the match.
 Huh? Huh?
 What happened, Supreme Leader?
 It's your turn. Make your move.
 Your Majesty... We must stop the bleeding!
 Do not make me repeat myself.
 Continue the match.
 It was I who said there would be no more breaks.
 Or do you insist that I embarrass myself again?
 I shall summon Neferpitou.
 I am sure that you can continue to play,
 as your arm is reattached.
 That is the best compromise I can offer.
 If you refuse to accept it,
 you may take my head now!
 Very well.
 Come closer.
 I shall end it with a single strike.
 It's your turn.
 Make your move.
 I refuse.
 I refuse to move before you
 have your injury treated.
 Don't make me repeat myself.
 Make your move.
 I refuse.
 If you wish to kill me,
 use Gungi!
 Why, you...
 Summon Pitou!
 At once!
 There's no doubt.
 All the puppets have vanished.
 Have they resumed the selection process?
 No, I doubt it.
 We have the capital surrounded.
 The King's safety is their top priority.
 They wouldn't leave him.
 Then what's going on?
 My assumption would be that
 some threat greater than us
 has befallen the Royal Guard,
 or upon the King himself.
 So this is it?
 Our golden opportunity?
 Yes...
 Our chance to infiltrate the palace.
 However, it may be a trap.
 That shouldn't be the case...
 They wouldn't use any tactic that
 might endanger the King.
 They would if the King ordered it.
 I suppose...
 Regardless, they've retracted
 their long-range radar.
 We should use this chance to
 get as close as possible.
 I must create a portal near the palace,
 or the plan will fail.
 This dangerous job had to be done eventually.
 And the time is now.
 There!
 I found them.
 It appears Cheetu failed.
 Try not to die.
 Same to you.
 They've split up for us.
 I found them.
 We'll switch to the man with the pipe!
 Let's go!
 Doctor Blythe.
 Toy Repair
 Doctor Blythe
 7-9-1, spy.
 2-3-1, pawn.
 How long will the operation take?
 I'd say two or three hours
 until complete recovery.
 And during that time, you cannot use
 either your puppets or En, correct?
 This ability requires a lot of Nen.
 A great deal of energy is needed to recreate flesh.
 While you treat His Majesty,
 I shall watch the surroundings.
 Though my En is nowhere as effective as yours.
 Regardless, this is an important task
 that I cannot trust to anyone else.
 As expected, I cannot sense any En use...
 The rain helps to lower visibility.
 Soon, the sun will set.
 Once it is night, I can hide in the darkness.
 And picking out enemy aura will be easier.
 Be patient.
 The closer the portal is to
 the palace, the better.
 But if I'm spotted, it will all be useless.
 While I can enter and exit freely,
 Shoot and the rest can only use
 the portal to leave once they enter.
 If the enemy prepares an ambush by the exit,
 it will mean serious trouble.
 I must prepare three exits in the area
 around the palace, one near, one far,
 and one somewhere in between, then
 place entrances even further away.
 I'll set up the entrances in groups of three,
 in locations where the palace is within sight.
 When the mission starts, we can enter
 by the most convenient location.
 Once it's time to act,
 the situation will determine
 whether we approach
 by the near exit, the far exit,
 or the one in between.
 Once that has been determined, we act.
 From the enemy's perspective,
 we will be appearing from nowhere.
 We must use that opening to separate
 the King and Royal Guard.
 That is when our battles will begin!
 It doesn't matter if we finish with a 1-3 record,
 so long as the King is their one loss.
 Under normal circumstances,
 I would already be within
 range of Neferpitou's En.
 This is quite tense...
 However, I am still far away.
 The farthest exit
 must be on the palace grounds,
 or it won't be any use to us!
 Advance carefully, but swiftly!
 Should I wait for the sun to set?
 But, will this scenario hold out until then?
 I have no choice...
 Should Neferpitou's En return,
 approaching the palace will be impossible.
 If I fail, we still have other options!
 I have nothing to fear.
 Advance...
 Advance...
 In the palace,
 there are three humans not intended as food.
 The first is the Gungi player.
 The second is Diego.
 And the third...
 is Secretary Bizeff.
 Behind the scenes, he was
 the country's true ruler.
 All dealings with foreign parties
 and domestic organizations
 went through him as an intermediary.
 Since he cannot be replaced,
 he is the only human allowed near the King.
 No human guards are posted near the palace.
 Because ordinary soldiers would
 be powerless against Nen users,
 the Royal Guard determined that the
 presence of ordinary soldiers would,
 in fact, increase the risk of infiltration.
 The only Squadron Leader present
 is Cheetu, who has just returned.
 There are only six other Captain and Soldier Ants.
 In other words,
 there are currently only three humans
 and eleven Ants in the palace.
 The Soldier Ants are
 the various Squadron Leaders' personal troops.
 Thus, they are not involved
 in the King's protection.
 Essentially, the Squadron Leaders
 no longer have any strict fealty to the King.
 They work together simply
 because their goals align.
 Understanding this, Pitou and the Royal Guard
 have assigned those Chimera Ants tasks
 that are expected to end in failure.
 Hence, they would not be trusted
 with monitoring the palace.
 However, Knov does not know this.
 As he attempts to infiltrate the palace,
 he has no idea that this is
 his best, and last, chance.
 I managed to survive somehow...
 But on my own, I can only work so much.
 I must convince them
 to at least provide three more
 staffers to do secretarial duties...
 Otherwise, I'll die of overwork.
 Sending list of available bodies.
 ""Thinker...
 Bell.""
 Per our arrangement,
 I request numbers 2, 16, 79, 103, and 119.
 This is it.
 He took the bait, Palm-kun!
 While Knov works to infiltrate the palace,
 Palm is preparing to launch
 her own infiltration plan.
 Next time: Knov x And x Morel.
 Today, this person is joining me!
 Why am I here?
 Because Killua isn't around!

 I shall take your left arm.
 Well... Instead of my left arm...
 Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?
 What?
 What do you bet?
 My life.
 Your life, was it?
 It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!
 Accept this apology.
 So this is it?
 Our golden opportunity?
 Yes...
 Our chance to infiltrate the palace.
 Knov x And x Morel
 Neferpitou has stopped
 using En, in order to heal the King's injury.
 Knov takes this opportunity
 to infiltrate the palace.
 Finally, I've gotten this close.
 Still more than one hundred meters
 to the central stairway.
 These strange trees bear very large fruit.
 Around five hundred per tree...
 And there are ten trees.
 A total of five thousand.
 Five hundred thousand people were to undergo
 the selection process each day,
 with a one-percent survival rate.
 But thanks to Killua's distractions,
 that schedule was only fulfilled on one day,
 so the numbers add up...
 These are cocoons holding the
 humans who were selected.
 Which means they will become Nen-wielding
 human weapons at the King's disposal,
 turning against the rest of humanity.
 Neferpitou is probably a Manipulator...
 and intends to manipulate these
 soldiers per the King's will,
 expanding his conquest throughout the world.
 I will not let that happen!
 First, the far exit... is set.
 Next...
 I must get closer.
 The palace entrance looks dark...
 So far, so good...
 Middle exit... set.
 Now for the near exit.
 There aren't any guards...
 I'd imagine only a select few are inside.
 This will work.
 If I've come this far,
 I can reach the inner palace.
 The throne room is on the third
 floor, at the rear and center.
 King
 We must delay any reinforcements,
 even if by only a second.
 Central Stairway
 The first floor is too far for that.
 The central stairway, second floor.
 That's the best location!
 The central stairway is beyond this courtyard...
 To be safe, I'll leave an exit here...
 No, that would be no different
 from the one outside...
 It should at least
 be next to the first floor's central stairway.
 Then, if I can, I'll go up from
 there to the second floor...
 Window Opener
 Scream
 Scream...
 Close!
 Are any others around?
 If I'm seen, it's over.
 I'll have to retreat...
 Nothing's coming?
 Then it was alone?
 This is it.
 I can't move beyond this point...
 If I do, I'll be killed.
 What is that aura?
 It appears to be full of all
 kinds of misfortune...
 At this point, I don't fear death.
 What I fear is that,
 before killing me,
 the monsters up there
 will squeeze every drop of information
 from me that I have on the King...
 Using any brutal means necessary.
 If I'm caught, I won't be able to resist...
 The aura's strength
 just confirms it...
 This is as far as I go...
 Oh, aren't you that lion guy from TV?
 My name is Leol, and don't forget it.
 I heard that I should expect
 a crayfish and wolf.
 They're dealing with the grunts you created.
 So I can fight you one-on-one.
 I appreciate that.
 This guy's just as strong as Cheetu.
 No, he's a little stronger.
 Let's get started.
 Right now, allowing Knov to get
 into the palace is the priority.
 Until that happens, I need to
 divert the enemy's attention.
 That won't help.
 This is Marcos.
 Do you have the meat?
 Yes, as requested.
 Refrigerated trucks are entering
 the underground warehouse...
 They're shipping in food.
 If the information Marcos
 provided was accurate,
 living women are also inside.
 Not for the King, but for the
 lecherous Secretary Bizeff.
 If everything is going as planned,
 Palm should be inside.
 Leave the fourth truck as it is.
 Yes, sir.
 Then we'll be leaving.
 Area D, of the underground warehouse.
 My very own paradise, where no one can interfere.
 Now, please step out.
 There's nothing to worry about.
 From now on, you will work here.
 I've prepared rooms for each of you.
 You will be provided with all necessities.
 In your spare time, you may do as you want.
 As long as you don't attempt to escape.
 Your only job
 is to follow my orders.
 When summoned, you must drop everything,
 and come to see me at once.
 Yes, Mr. Secretary.
 Excellent.
 You...
 Come with me.
 Yes.
 The rest of you can wait in your rooms.
 Yes...
 The Secretary was...
 ...interested in us!
 I must find a way out of here,
 so I can see the King and his Royal Guard.
 Using her crystal ball, Palm can observe
 the current whereabouts of
 anyone she has seen previously.
 This power will allow her to keep tabs
 on the King and Royal Guard.
 The Hunters will then be able to determine
 the optimal route for the operation.
 Only one exit.
 I'll have to manipulate Bizeff.
 My mission is crucial for
 increasing our chances
 of defeating the King!
 What matters most isn't that I succeed...
 But that, should I fail and be captured,
 I kill myself immediately.
 I should be safe here...
 Palm...
 Don't do anything foolish!
 I managed to place the exits,
 so even if your mission doesn't succeed,
 we can still execute the operation.
 If you get caught, it's over...
 That...
 That...
 That vicious aura...
 One look
 was all it took
 to break my will...
 Gon... Killua...
 You must have seen that aura...
 You were probably even closer,
 actually touching it...
 Yet...
 How are you still able
 to face them?
 How can you bring yourself to fight?
 Is it to save your friends?
 To protect humanity?
 Why...
 Why are you still fighting?
 Palm!
 Please...
 Don't do anything foolish.
 I beg you...
 If you're caught, it's all over...
 Palm!
 I won't be able...
 to go back there...
 I brought you something cold to drink.
 You're dismissed.
 Wait in your room.
 Yes.
 Your lack of familiarity with the
 area has sealed your defeat.
 Though it's almost too perfect that,
 after all that running,
 you ended up in an underground church.
 In case of emergency, this place
 is used as an air shelter.
 An ideal place to die in a vain struggle.
 Well, you'll have to say your own prayers.
 I'm an atheist.
 You're a cocky guy.
 Let's see who's trapped whom.
 Cheetu told me everything.
 I hear you can mold that
 smoke into various objects.
 Knowing that, he still chased me in here?
 Even better.
 If he believes things are going his way,
 he won't hesitate to display his abilities.
 However,
 I've yet to meet anyone whose power
 allows them to react more
 flexibly than Deep Purple.
 I can feel the tension in the air... I love it.
 Both of us waiting to reveal our abilities...
 I really dig it.
 It's common sense to defeat an opponent
 before they can use their power.
 But that isn't how men
 should fight.
 Hey, what are you up to?
 Voluntarily removing one of your senses?
 Have you heard of the band Black Planet?
 Their second album is super cool.
 It's a twelve-song medley.
 Listening to the whole thing's
 like reading a good book.
 When you finish it, you feel great.
 I know.
 And best part of all, the medley's
 exactly sixty minutes long.
 It's a masterpiece!
 I hate to admit it, but I agree.

 an underground church,
 where they will now fight one another.
 This ability only activates when it rains.
 Inamura!
 Return x And x Retire
 My Inamura
 summons waves!
 Well? Aren't my big waves rad?
 I can easily wash away your wimpy smoke!
 You're having trouble moving
 in the water, right?
 You like how easily my board can maneuver?
 If you stand still, I'll give you a quick death.
 That's not your ability.
 It belongs
 to my buddy!
 Oh, making a boat of smoke?
 So he can stand on that smoke?
 You think that's enough to defeat my waves?
 I told you, that's not your ability!
 This one is my own original...
 Tornave!
 Maelstrom!!
 Tornave
 The current's so strong...
 I can't tell up from down.
 This is bad.
 I can't control my body at all...
 I stop my opponent's
 movements with a whirlpool.
 Here I go!
 Then, I finish him with a harpoon from above!
 My harpoon can match the speed of sound,
 and pierce a whale at the very bottom
 of the ocean, even from the sky!
 Take this!
 He disappeared?
 Impossible!
 The whirlpool should have incapacitated him.
 He had no way to escape.
 Bastard...
 How did you do it?
 I simply exhaled.
 When it comes to lung capacity,
 no one in the world beats me.
 He used his breath as jet propulsion
 to break out of the whirlpool?
 Okay, it's my turn now!
 It's your turn?
 In this battle, you don't get a turn!
 All you get to do is drown in my waves!
 During this exchange, I've learned three things.
 First, I now know your power.
 Somehow, you're able to use
 other people's abilities.
 And those earphones
 have nothing to do with your power.
 They're either for show or for luck.
 Or it means someone is sending you orders.
 If he meant to impair his hearing
 to strengthen his power,
 he shouldn't be able to hear me talk.
 What's the third thing?
 Your lifespan.
 That Inamura ability belongs
 to a Hunter named Grachan.
 You probably encountered and defeated
 him when he was sent
 to fight the Chimera Ants.
 I'll punish you for stealing my buddy's ability!
 Your life ends today!
 Hold on...
 That's a totally one-sided misinterpretation.
 I was protecting myself from humans
 who were hunting me down.
 It was self-defense.
 And I didn't steal his ability.
 I'm just borrowing it for a bit.
 Just borrowing it for a bit?
 That's an excuse thieves use.
 Well, arguing with you is pointless.
 I'd like to get my hands on his ability,
 but defeating him is more important.
 Right now, our top priority
 is to defeat one another.
 I'll repeat myself...
 I'm sorry, but you don't get a turn!
 Big Wall!
 Giant Wave
 Big Wall
 I'm flooding this underground church.
 My wall of water's gonna suck you in!
 Just try and find your way to the surface!
 Now, will he make it up?
 Will I smash his skull with my board?
 Launch my harpoon through his gut?
 Which do I choose?
 Either way,
 if he shows his face above water, he's done.
 He isn't coming back up...
 Has he drowned?
 No,
 he was confident about his lung capacity.
 That means he can survive for
 ten or twenty minutes.
 No, wait.
 It's just possible
 that he's able to remain underwater like a whale!
 There you are!
 Don't move!
 I'll impale you with my harpoon.
 Bubbles on the opposite side, too?
 And over here!
 And over there!
 There are air bubbles everywhere...
 I see...
 It's possible, if he formed his smoke
 into a hose with multiple branches.
 That way, he wouldn't give away his position.
 Hey! How long are you gonna stay under?
 Do you expect me to give up and drain the water?
 No, that isn't it!
 The bubbles are camouflage!
 Is he running?
 If his lung capacity is that great, it's possible
 he could swim out through the maze of
 underground corridors leading down here.
 I can't let him escape!
 I told Welfin and Brovada to stay out of this,
 so I could take all the credit...
 My head's spinning?
 And my chest hurts...
 Have I been poisoned?
 My board disappeared?
 Is it because my physical and
 mental stability are compromised?
 Can't move...
 Can't breathe...
 My power stopped working,
 but the water hasn't gone away?
 Because we're underground?
 Crap...
 I let him think he had the advantage
 so I could turn the tables on him.
 But it looks as though the one
 who was backed into a corner...
 was me...
 Am I gonna die?
 Am I... Am I gonna die here?
 So he was using smoke hoses
 to send air bubbles everywhere.
 But what kind of...
 poison did he use?
 That was faster than I expected.
 The poison you've inhaled is lethal.
 But it's something naturally found in air.
 Carbon dioxide.
 Carbon Dioxide
 Morel used his immense lung capacity
 to suck in the stagnant air trapped in the church,
 and exhaled it with an increased
 concentration of carbon dioxide.
 I started my attack
 before you ever began.
 If he was telling the truth,
 Grachan should be getting his ability back.
 I have a few hours in which to move around.
 During that time, I must see
 them with my own eyes!
 I've observed Bizeff's movements
 with my crystal ball.
 I know how to leave this area.
 Even if Bizeff learns I've escaped,
 he can't tell anyone because
 he's kept this area a secret.
 They are...
 up above.
 I can't go any farther.
 But...
 Oh? How are you feeling?
 Octopus! Where am I?
 How long was I out?
 Don't call me an octopus!
 This is an underground clinic for folks
 with roots in the underworld.
 You were out for two whole days.
 Two days?! I need to get going!
 Hey!
 You shouldn't move around!
 Your wounds will reopen.
 I have to follow through with the plan...
 Fool!
 You were just on the verge of death!
 You need a few days beforeâ€”
 Oh, you're awake?
 That's great.
 Thanks for everything you've done.
 I'm checking out now.
 Not until you pay me.
 Your total bill comes to 1.8 million Jenny.
 If you can't pay, I'll take body parts instead.
 I don't have my wallet on me.
 I'll wire it to you when I get back.
 I'm not stupid enough to trust
 that you'll keep that promise.
 Until you find someone to bring
 the money, you're staying here.
 I don't have time for that!
 Give me a phone!
 It costs 10,000 Jenny per minute.
 Would you just shut up and go away?
 Hello?
 Hey, it's me.
 Killua!
 Where are you? Are you okay?
 What happened?
 I'll explain when I see you.
 A strong enemy gave me some trouble.
 I've been in the hospital.
 Oh...
 Well, I'm glad you called.
 This means you're okay now, right?
 Yeah, I'll be back soon.
 Anything happen on your side?
 We've found a strong ally.
 He's bonding with Knuckle.
 We have a plan that could
 defeat the King if it goes well.
 Oh...
 We should meet, so I can hear what you think.
 Okay.
 Then, I need you to send money
 to a certain bank account.
 If you do that, we can rendezvous today.
 That just leaves Palm.
 You haven't been able to reach her?
 No.
 She's probably still in the palace...
 But wouldn't that mean Neferpitou's
 Nen has already exposed her?
 I imagine she's in the warehouse,
 beneath the palace.
 There are about five kilometers
 of corridors surrounding it.
 Pitou's En can't reach that far.
 But since the exit is in the
 palace, she can't get out.
 How's Knov-san doing?
 Well...
 he's probably out of this fight.
 But he did manage to place the exits.
 There's no change to our plan.
 Three days to go...
 His wounds are already healed!
 No problem.
 Okay, I confirmed receipt of the money.
 You can leave. Right now.
 What are you doing?
 Let's go.
 Huh?
 We're gonna join my buddies.
 I'll introduce you.
 But...
 Well, I won't force you.
 I'll just tell you this.
 Thank you.
 Uh, wait...
 Actually...
 It's okay if I come?
 I mean, I'm just a...
 What?
 Was I the only one who thought
 we were already friends?
 It's really...
 okay?
 It isn't about what's okay.
 It's whether you're coming or not.
 I'm going! I'm going with you!
 I want to make something clear.
 The next time something like this happens,
 I won't bother thanking you.
 So if something happens,
 and I end up helping you,
 you don't need to thank me.
 Friends are supposed to help friends.
 From now on, we'll be working together.
 So we'll be helping each other.
 Supporting each other isn't a big deal.
 It'd be lame to thank each other
 for every little thing.
 Yeah, this is it.
 This is the world I wanted.
 The world I longed for and sought...
 But deep down, I thought
 it was beyond my reach...
 That it wasn't meant for me...
 And wouldn't happen...
 I'd given up on this world.
 I thought it wasn't meant to be...
 Killua, I'm...
 I'm so happy, I could die!
 Huh? Why are you crying?
 Because...
 Because you're doing this for me!
 Come on...
 I want to make one more thing clear.
 The world you're stepping into is far more brutal
 than the world of the Chimera Ants.
 They may seem similar,
 but there's a huge difference between
 risking a life and throwing it away.
 People staring death in the face every day
 don't want to hear that someone's ready to die.
 Only people who maintain a daily
 regimen to stay in tip-top shape,
 and can swallow just enough poison to
 fall short of a lethal dose, get to survive.
 That's how it goes.
 Are you ready to join us?
 How could you know
 the words I most wanted to hear?
 A foolish question.
 I see paradise before me.
 I'm going, no matter what it costs me.
 I've seen the other side...
 I've made contact.
 I've learned it really exists...
 And I can reach it!
 Next time: Gungi x Of x Komugi.
 2-1-3, marshal.
 4-5-1, knight.
 8-7-uh...
 lieutenant general!
 4-3-3... 2?
 My phone number!
",0.7401987135410308,0.7110793948173523,0.6709763899445533,0.4870206456631422,0.5279519543051719,0.21098954733461142
108,"Three days remain until the selection begins.
 In the palace, the King has
 completed his recovery,
 and continues to play Gungi without rest.
 That's checkmate.
 Her mind and body are at their limit.
 I estimate it will only take another
 match or two before the King wins.
 Gungi x Of x Komugi
 Time for a break.
 We will resume in a half day.
 Wait, I can keep going!
 If you can barely sit straight,
 the victory won't satisfy me.
 Recover your strength.
 Even while his arm was being treated,
 the King never stopped playing.
 But now he changes his mind?
 This female is dangerous.
 If this continues,
 she could prove quite troublesome...
 Then, I will excuse myself.
 I must not be too hasty.
 The King chose to retract his decree.
 In order to stay true to his convictions...
 In order to defeat the Gungi
 Champion at her best...
 In order to demonstrate his strength!
 If I kill this girl now,
 the King will remain a loser at Gungi forever.
 Her death will cement her status
 as someone the King could never defeat!
 I am such a fool!
 My hasty impulse could have left
 the King with a permanent scar!
 I shall die of my own volition!
 Once I have seen the King conquer the world...
 Using Knov-san's Apartment Complex,
 seven people will infiltrate the palace.
 Shoot and me...
 Gon, Killua,
 Meleoron, Ikalgo,
 and then Morel.
 A few seconds after us,
 the Chairman will enter from beyond Pitou's En.
 During that time, we must draw
 the Royal Guard from the King.
 Gon, Killua, and Ikalgo will go in first.
 When we suddenly appear
 in the midst of the palace,
 their immediate reaction will be...
 To protect the King with their lives.
 They'll probably use a formation like this.
 Breaking it won't be easy.
 And that's where I come in.
 Okay, any questions?
 Uh, about Palm...
 Can we do anything to learn
 what's happened to her?
 She's either dead or in hiding.
 If she'd gotten out, she'd have contacted us.
 Since she hasn't, that's the only explanation.
 If she were captured,
 she'd have taken her own life.
 When she left, she was prepared for that.
 If we try to check in on her,
 it would be an insult to her resolve.
 Hey, you're being too harsh!
 Gon's just concerned about Palm.
 And his concern is worthless.
 What's that?!
 You just came back! Where do you get off?!
 Assuming that Palm was captured alive,
 it would mean the enemy knows our plan.
 Which would make us like moths
 flying straight into the flame.
 We'll be destroyed instantly.
 But instead of worrying about worst-case scenarios,
 what's important is that we trust Palm.
 Well, that certainly makes sense,
 but Gon's point might be that,
 if Palm has met such a fate, we still
 have time to change the plan.
 Think again.
 He'll say that we have to save Palm first.
 But he won't offer any plans for that.
 Right?
 R-Right...
 I see your point...
 I know you're worried,
 but once the operation starts,
 you'll have to forget her until we're done.
 If you're distracted for a fraction of a second,
 that might cause our operation to fail.
 We still have two days...
 There's still time for Palm to contact us.
 Nyow I understand.
 Should I have tried to escape to the right?
 You should have moved your knight.
 I didn't want to let a single piece
 control the center of the board.
 Sometimes, you must accept
 the risk and move forward.
 Otherwise, you won't ever be
 able to make me hesitate.
 I am unaccustomed to playing a waiting game.
 Your Majesty...
 What is it?
 I have some sensitive information,
 so we should step outside.
 It's fine, speak.
 Two days remain until the National Celebration.
 The number of citizens to process in Peijing
 has increased beyond our expectations.
 But the weather forecast is favorable,
 so the selection should proceed as planned.
 Get to the point.
 I would like to move up
 the post-selection schedule.
 That's it? Do as you wish.
 Yes, sir.
 In that case, we will depart
 immediately after the selection—
 Don't make me repeat myself!
 I'm telling you to decide on your own.
 Do not return until I summon you.
 So you were chased out, too?
 Well, we only need to wait for the King to win.
 You think that will only be a
 few more matches, right?
 No.
 Wasn't that what you said a while ago?
 The King is improving at a remarkable rate.
 However, she is also evolving.
 I am no longer able to predict the outcome.
 Well, it's still only a matter of
 time before the King wins.
 I hope you're right.
 I am. There's nothing to worry about.
 I am one hundred percent confident
 that he's acting on his own...
 The man who defeated Leol.
 The reports from Welfin and Brovada confirm it.
 The soldiers under his control
 are all smoke puppets.
 Since their complex movements
 are not typical of Nen puppets,
 they fooled me as effectively as a smokescreen.
 He can't control as many puppets as I can,
 but his are more responsive.
 I want to fight him...
 But I can't leave my post.
 Maybe he'll come to me...
 It's about time for us to enter Peijing.
 The enemy should have noticed
 Morel's distraction by now.
 We'll make some noise in Peijing to negate
 their belief that this is all the work of one man.
 At the same time,
 many citizens will be moving toward the palace.
 If we disappear the day before the celebration,
 they'll believe assassins are hidden
 among the citizens, trying to kill the King.
 And their focus will be outside
 the palace, on the crowds.
 That's when we enter the palace with
 Four-Dimensional Apartment Complex!
 The King will definitely be here.
 Watching the selection from
 the third-floor throne room.
 Will he really be there?
 Something...
 feels off.
 2-1-3, pawn.
 4-5-1, knight.
 8-7-2, lieutenant general.
 4-3-3, archer.
 She continues to attack where
 I'm weak without hesitation.
 As we play, she's getting sharper.
 2-1-1, knight.
 6-6-1, major general.
 But it does not pain me.
 Rather, I find this enjoyable.
 Because the board dictates my every move.
 Which proves that she is still
 several levels above me.
 How strong can she become?
 Supreme Leader...
 I feel...
 strange.
 I can't stop.
 Marvelous moves keep flooding into my mind...
 I can become even better!
 Has she awakened?
 Then she's only
 begun to grow.
 That's checkmate.
 Could I take a short break?
 It's the first time she's asked for a break...
 Is something wrong?
 No, I'd like to return to my room to
 record the moves that are in my mind.
 But you can't see...
 Oh, I'll just move the pieces around the board!
 When I touch the pieces after they're placed,
 I will never forget their position.
 She's memorized every placement
 she's ever experienced?
 Very well, you're excused.
 Thank you.
 A foolish question...
 Her name...
 Hey.
 What is your name?
 You mean mine?
 Is there anyone else around?
 It's K-K-Komugi.
 Komugi?
 Supreme Leader...
 Can you please tell me
 what your name is?
 My name?
 What...
 am I called?
 Pitou.
 Yes, what do you need?
 Pouf.
 Yes.
 Youpi.
 Yes.
 Is something the matter?
 Pouf...
 Yes?
 Right, you're Pouf.
 Then...
 What is my name?
 I speak with utmost respect, Your Majesty...
 You are the King. You have no other name.
 You are the one and only King.
 At the moment, there are impostors
 using that name without permission,
 but we will eliminate them all.
 So that the entire world will
 know there is only one King.
 That assumes the others can be eliminated.
 ""King"" is a title.
 A title can be bestowed, and it is not a name.
 What of you, Youpi?
 Your question is far beyond my capacity.
 I cannot think of a way to provide an answer.
 Pitou.
 I believe that your feelings
 are what matter most.
 You should select the name
 that you find most pleasing.
 Very well, then.
 You can choose a name after the selection.
 Right now, our priority is to finish all the
 preparations before tomorrow morning.
 Your Majesty, is something wrong?
 If you have any concerns, we shall address them.
 That is why we are here.
 Komugi's entire body was glowing.
 Komugi?
 The girl with the closed eyes.
 He's remembered that human's name.
 She experienced an awakening.
 Komugi will now become much stronger,
 although only at Gungi.
 Pitou...
 Yes.
 If Komugi were put through the selection
 that will occur tomorrow, what would happen?
 She would die.
 The selection chooses humans
 with the physical and mental
 strength to serve as soldiers.
 The survivors will be those who demonstrate
 excellent combat capabilities.
 Your Majesty, please...
 After meeting Komugi,
 I've learned that strength can
 manifest in different ways.
 For example, during our trip here...
 Your Majesty, please stop.
 ...I killed a child.
 Your Majesty, you must not say it...
 Perhaps that child...
 It isn't right... It's inappropriate!
 ...had the potential to surpass
 me in a certain field.
 An almighty King...
 Yet I extinguished that potential.
 ...can never show regret!
 I extinguished it for no real reason.
 You must not say any more!
 I am...
 King!
 I took a life for no reason at all...
 What tremendous strength I must possess!
 I appear with no warning, to rob
 countless beings of their inferior strength!
 To crush... To destroy.
 That is my power.
 Brute force is the strongest
 power in this world!
 I am not worthy of being a Royal Guard...
 Why not?
 I jumped to the wrong conclusion,
 and I nearly insulted the King.
 I was foolish enough to think that the King
 might have regretted his actions...
 You always think too much.
 Yes, that is correct.
 Well, the King has changed since that girl arrived.
 Yes, that is true.
 If the girl will impede the King,
 we should kill her.
 To think my mind operates
 on the same level as yours...
 Yes...
 My power is the strongest that exists.
 All other power means nothing
 in the face of my own.
 They are as dust in the wind.
 Komugi... That female is no different.
 Her skill is in Gungi, a simple board game.
 I could turn her into no more than
 a source of meat with the barest touch.
 So her life depends on my mood.
 If I change my mind,
 I can immediately kill her!
 Then why am I so hesitant?
 The goal was to kill time while
 waiting for the selection.
 The selection is tomorrow...
 Haven't I had enough?
 I've had my fun. I no longer need her.
 Do I kill her now?!
 Th-Thank you very much...
 Why did you not call for help?
 Here...
 And here...
 You're covered in blood!
 Damn, I don't believe it.
 She's such a fragile creature!
 Because it's still early...
 I don't want to bother anyone else.
 You aren't bothering anyone.
 What am...
 You are an important guest!
 ...I saying?
 Didn't I come here to kill her?
 Why do you cry?!
 Why can't I do it?
 I'm sorry!
 But... But...
 No one's ever been this nice to me!
 What is this creature?
 What do I want
 to do with her?
 Next time: Taking Stock x And x Taking Action.
 Killua-sama, all these marvelous ideas
 keep flooding into my mind—

 Taking Stock x And x Taking Action
 One day remains before the selection.
 The capital city, Peijing, wakes to a quiet morning.
 Good morning.
 You boys are up early.
 We have nineteen hours until
 midnight strikes on selection day.
 Tonight, we finally make our move.
 Let's do one final check.
 Once inside, Gon and I
 immediately head up the central stairway,
 toward the throne room.
 Yep.
 Ikalgo will take
 the northeast elevator down to the
 basement, to search for Palm.
 If you find her, escape without us.
 Right.
 If the King and his three Royal Guards
 are in the throne room,
 we proceed with the plan.
 The problem is, what if they're not there?
 You're really hung up on that...
 What are the chances of that happening?
 Well, it's highly unlikely.
 But the unusual happens pretty often.
 Aren't you contradicting yourself?
 We researched the enemy's behavior extensively
 before deciding on a day for the attack.
 When you're waiting for someone to be
 in a certain place, at a certain time,
 that's typically when the unexpected happens.
 In my old job, I saw this all the time.
 The unusual always happens
 on the day you've chosen.
 In my old job, I could wait for the next chance,
 to ensure my success.
 But this time, that isn't an option.
 We can't wait.
 Once we move, there's no turning back.
 A moment's hesitation can mean death!
 So we should take time now to decide
 how we'll act in different situations.
 Even if they aren't in the throne room,
 if they're still in the palace, it's okay.
 Pitou's En is enough to cover the palace and
 its surrounding courtyards, and then some.
 So if we sense that creepy aura when we enter,
 we'll know that they're there.
 From there, we just follow that
 sinister aura to where it feels densest,
 and they'll be at its center.
 The question is what we do if
 we don't sense Pitou's aura.
 In other words, what we do
 if they aren't in the palace.
 Or if they're in the palace,
 but they aren't using En.
 Would they be in the palace,
 but not using En to guard the King?
 That's what happened when
 Knov-san infiltrated the palace!
 Huh?
 Yes, that's what I can't make sense of.
 According to Colt, Knov saw Pouf's aura.
 The Royal Guard never leaves the King's side.
 So if Pouf was there, the other two were
 also in the palace with the King.
 Then, why did Pitou stop
 using the puppets and En,
 leaving Pouf to handle security,
 which allowed Knov to infiltrate the palace?
 I believe the reason has to do with
 how Pitou's power works...
 Then we should ask Colt.
 Yeah.
 I'd guess that during that time,
 Pitou was healing someone.
 Healing?
 I told you that Pitou was the
 one who restored Kite, yes?
 Thinking back, I don't believe Pitou
 used En during that period.
 Thus, healing must require a
 great deal of concentration.
 So while healing someone,
 Pitou cannot use En or the puppets.
 Now it makes sense.
 Which means that someone,
 most likely the King or one of the
 Royal Guard, was injured and
 required healing, so the En
 and puppets disappeared.
 But hold on...
 Who would have been able to
 injure one of those monsters?
 True...
 An internal dispute?
 Maybe the King injured one of the Royal Guard?
 No, that's impossible.
 There is no chance that Pitou
 would endanger the King
 by removing that En to heal someone else!
 I guarantee it.
 Which means that the one injured...
 ...was the King!
 I see... What you're saying makes sense.
 But then the bigger question
 is who injured the King.
 The Royal Guard wouldn't harm him.
 But other soldiers could never put
 so much as a scratch on him.
 Yep, so our conclusion was...
 The King injured himself?!
 Under what circumstances
 would that have happened?
 We don't know why, but it's the only explanation.
 I'll admit that I didn't question our
 sudden stroke of luck too much...
 But that chance was only possible
 under abnormal circumstances.
 Are they starting to lose control?
 That isn't good...
 I'm starting to think something's
 going on inside the palace.
 We will now begin moving to the palace.
 Citizens of sector A-1, assemble in
 Diego Plaza at once.
 The citizens of the other sectors
 should prepare to move out.
 Oh, they're starting to file out.
 They've begun their march...
 Ten hours until midnight, when the selection starts.
 In twenty-five hours, tomorrow afternoon at three,
 five million humans will fill the palace grounds.
 Has the situation in Peijing changed?
 I thought it was only one skilled enemy,
 but now there are a bunch.
 So there are reinforcements.
 They may try to use the celebration
 as cover to approach us.
 Then the danger will be greatest
 during the selection.
 Yes, since the King will be
 participating in the selection.
 Our greatest concern is
 the King somehow being taken beyond our reach.
 Assuming that they have a Nen
 user capable of translocation,
 and that that person can use the ability
 to isolate the King somewhere else...
 That means at least one of us must stay
 by the King's side during the selection.
 The King won't allow it.
 As it is, he's been upset by how
 close we've stayed to him.
 Then we guard him secretly,
 without his knowledge.
 We need someone to stay just close
 enough to monitor his surroundings
 while still carrying out his own role in the selection...
 Whose size won't attract attention,
 who won't get absorbed in an amusing task...
 Very well, I am the best choice for this.
 Strictly by process of elimination, of course...
 What's wrong?
 Their presences have completely disappeared.
 I can't sense any residual aura.
 They must be using Zetsu to hide
 among the marching humans.
 Hey.
 There are so many people...
 Around a hundred per building.
 They must have been packed inside.
 Then if we conceal our presences,
 they can only assume that we're
 hiding among the citizens.
 Maybe they'll cancel the march?
 No way.
 That would mean delaying or
 even canceling the celebration.
 Which would imply the King had
 accepted defeat and compromised.
 The Royal Guard won't let that happen.
 The celebration will begin as scheduled,
 no matter the cost.
 Tomorrow morning, at 3 PM!
 And that won't change.
 Once the humans began to move,
 my puppets could no longer tell them apart...
 Should I recall them?
 No, giving the enemy free
 rein would be dangerous.
 Have the puppets join the soldiers that
 are guiding the citizens, as a deterrent.
 'Sup?
 As expected, the puppets have joined the march.
 In another hour, those sectors will be deserted.
 There are six entrances to the
 rooms that lead to the palace.
 We'll avoid the entrances in front of the
 palace, where security will be tighter,
 and wait by entrances A, B,
 and C, behind the palace.
 Once we've entered the rooms,
 the only exit will lead inside the palace.
 What? You scared?
 Don't be absurd.
 I merely want to be sure we're prepared.
 Waiting by the entrances involves
 quite a lot of risk.
 But if we enter the rooms too early,
 we won't be able to exit until midnight.
 True...
 If we receive any useful information,
 we want to be free to act on it...
 And we can't use cell phones near the palace,
 since the Ants will pick up on the signal.
 I think it's dangerous to spend hours
 waiting inside the rooms,
 not knowing if there have been
 accidents or changes in the situation.
 But you're the one who said it was
 risky to wait outside the palace.
 Yes...
 You shouldn't take their security net lightly.
 I'll take care of it.
 I'm the only one who can freely
 enter and exit these rooms.
 If anything happens, I'll tell you.
 For now, you should rest here.
 Will you be okay?
 I shouldn't have any problem
 investigating the area...
 Even if I'm right beside the palace, as long
 as I'm out of range of Pitou's En...
 But you should be careful.
 Pitou doesn't use a standard circular En.
 It changes shape like an amoeba,
 giving it extended range.
 That's what Kite came in contact with.
 And it was probably deliberate...
 It's a fighter's instinct to want to know
 how strong the opponent is.
 And his instinct led him to misjudge their strength.
 In some areas, that En can
 stretch two kilometers.
 Make sure you stay out of range.
 Don't worry about it.
 In this room, I'm the one who most fears them.
 I won't do anything crazy.
 I promise you that.
 We will now head to the palace.
 Any person who leaves their line
 will be shot on the spot.
 Move out!
 Pitou...
 You knew that Komugi was being attacked?
 Yes, I was monitoring the area with En.
 However,
 I determined that there was no threat
 to Your Majesty, so I ignored it.
 From now on, monitor Komugi's surroundings,
 and deal with any threats at once.
 Yes, as you command.
 Tens of thousands of people are marching
 in a line toward the King.
 Like ants... No, lemmings.
 A march of death.
 It will be dark soon.
 I can tell Morel and the
 others to come out...
 What is
 that?
 Wing scales?
 The wind is carrying the scales of
 his wings toward the citizens...
 That means...
 As I thought...
 They all look completely vacant and dazed.
 Those scales have a hypnotic effect.
 Stay in line as you advance!
 Stay in line!
 Once you reach your position, wait for orders.
 Do not move!
 Simple orders delivered repeatedly,
 while tanks roll in the background
 can easily seep into a mind exhausted
 from hours of marching...
 It's the perfect situation for using hypnosis!
 Once the selection begins,
 and blood starts to fly,
 they will continue to quietly stand in place.
 Until it's their turn.
 Hypnosis? I see...
 If they're brainwashed, the citizens won't run.
 But this works out for us.
 Eh?
 If we make a lot of noise,
 we won't have to worry about citizens panicking.
 Ah!
 There won't be any stampede of humans
 falling over each other to escape.
 That's a big boon.
 Assuming that over half of the people
 will be in place at midnight,
 we would have expected a stampede to
 leave tens of thousands of casualties.
 Our biggest concern has been addressed.
 We can go crazy.
 Six hours to go.
 Everyone's here.
 Have you heard from Palm?
 No.
 Oh...
 We'll keep waiting until half
 an hour before go time.
 If we knew what's inside before
 going in, it'd be very different...
 Yeah.
 They both look composed.
 Killua, in particular, shows
 none of the mental weakness he
 displayed when we fought.
 I'd almost say he's brimming with confidence.
 But for some reason,
 he seems on the verge of fading away.
 No, I don't have time to worry about others.
 I'm the one suffering from the most anxiety.
 The fate of humanity rests on me...
 Colt is a good guy...
 Meleoron and Ikalgo both have good hearts.
 It doesn't matter if they're humans or Ants.
 Everyone has a heart.
 That's what I want to believe.
 Hopefully, the King also has one.
 But some of them must be killed...
 If we don't kill them, we'll be killed!
 Kite, it's almost time.
 I promise to turn you back...
 By defeating that Ant.
 He's fired up...
 I'll focus on providing support.
 So no one can interfere in your battle...
 Using my new Kanmuru technique.
 My body feels heavy.
 I'm suffering from days without rest...
 On a scale of 1 to 100, my current
 condition would be 40...
 No, 35...
 But I can't be whining now.
 With Knov out, I'm the only one left.
 I was hoping to fight at full strength,
 but it's easier to accept my fate this way.
 I'll focus on playing the decoy and
 drawing my target from the King.
 I'm sorry, Morel and everyone...
 But I can't bring myself to go.
 I'll take a look outside.
 So two minutes is the longest
 I can hold my breath...
 Given how tense I'll be inside, my limit
 will probably be, at most, half that.
 Good enough...
 One minute is more than enough time!
 Tomorrow, at midnight, I will be reborn.
 A few days ago, I couldn't have
 dreamed of such a life.
 Thank you, Killua.
 I promise to carry out my mission for you!
 Tomorrow will be my birthday!
 I am the King.
 But who am I?
 Why was I brought into this world?
 Time's up... Let's go!
 Palm...
 Ten minutes remain until
 they enter the palace.
 Next time: Confusion x And x Expectation.
 It's so cold, Gon...
 They said Admiral Winter is coming!
 I think you mean General Winter.

 is progressively closer to the throne room.
 Okay, we're all agreed.
 We'll all use the closest exit,
 and bust in from beside the central stairway.
 Confusion x And x Expectation
 This seemed like a good idea
 since Leol-sama praised me so much,
 but dispelling Nen is hard.
 And the stronger the Nen,
 the bigger my stomach gets.
 This was a bad idea.
 To a girl, there's nothing
 worse than losing your figure.
 I should ask Leol-sama for a larger reward!
 Right, Shidore?
 Having a peon that understands
 speech is useful, but...
 You really need to talk more.
 You have permission to shoot her on sight!
 As a foreigner, she can't blend
 in with the other citizens!
 Damn! Damn that woman!
 What does she want?
 Hey!
 How many times have I told you
 not to use your cell phone here?
 The radio waves irritate my ears,
 and it gives me a headache!
 Plus, I can hear what you're saying.
 Next time I catch you, I'll snap your
 phone and your arm in half.
 W-Well... There are urgent matters
 that must be dealt with.
 I need to use my phone.
 It's so urgent that you find
 the woman who ran away?
 I can find her for you.
 R-Really?
 My nose happens to be very sharp...
 If you have something she wore, I can track her.
 The Royal Guard appreciates the work you do,
 and I respect you, as well!
 So, a little give-and-take will benefit us both here.
 O-Okay!
 Hold on, and I'll bring you something.
 I will become the King behind the scenes.
 To accomplish that, I must be friendly
 with Bizeff, not with the King.
 Welfin-sama, an urgent alert has been issued.
 Bah.
 When peons send transmissions,
 it gives me a headache.
 This smells like...
 Taragette's blood.
 There are bloodstains and dirty shoes.
 An intruder!
 If he took his shoes off here
 to avoid leaving footprints,
 he must be somewhere deeper within.
 He didn't hide his shoes because
 he had a pressing mission and
 couldn't afford to lose time...
 That day last week, when it rained?
 That was the day Taragette went missing.
 I'm pretty sure that the intruder killed him.
 But that means he disposed of Taragette's body
 while leaving his shoes behind.
 There's no blood trail nearby.
 If he wrapped the body in something to move it,
 he must have come prepared.
 Was kidnapping a soldier his mission?
 Why would they do that?!
 Damn, I don't get this!
 Should I ask Shaiapouf for advice?
 No, I'll catch the intruder,
 and get the answers from him.
 He did head inside the palace!
 This guy comes before Bizeff's woman...
 Follow me!
 What is your name?
 It's K-K-Komugi.
 Can you please tell me what your name is?
 I didn't get to learn his name...
 I can't wait to play him again!
 Who am I?
 A nameless king... in a borrowed castle.
 My subjects are mindless puppets.
 If this is the fate that the
 heavens have granted me...
 I have no doubt that I shall
 be slowly bored to death!
 Don't follow me.
 Yes, but—
 Do not make me repeat myself.
 Now we've all been beaten by the King.
 The King says your En is irritating him.
 I figured he would be saying that soon.
 But I can't remove our security...
 Then you go and tell him that!
 I don't want another beating.
 How does this sound?
 We can block all aura in a radius
 surrounding Your Majesty.
 This way, my presence will not bother you.
 Are you telling me to stay in one place?
 Given that keeping
 the aura-free zone around me
 while I move wouldn't be possible.
 I refuse to have my movement
 constantly monitored.
 No, that would not be our proposal.
 So if I do not wish to deal with your presence,
 I will only be able to move
 within that confined area.
 I must order you to move that zone
 should I wish to go elsewhere?
 There is nothing more I can say.
 Keep your En focused outside the palace.
 I shall put up with that until tomorrow's selection.
 Are you dissatisfied?
 Should that not suffice to guard
 against outside attacks?
 Or are you saying that there
 are already enemies inside?
 That would be admitting that your En
 is completely worthless, would it not?
 You're absolutely correct.
 If my En is focused only outside, it cannot detect
 any attack from underground.
 In addition,
 my En is not capable of recognizing
 an enemy that is already inside.
 Do you mean Komugi?
 No, eleven soldiers still remain within the palace,
 and they are free to enter and leave at will.
 A check is performed each time someone enters,
 but if the soldier were being
 controlled by the enemy,
 it would be difficult to know for sure.
 That means—
 Enough.
 You may use En on the first floor of the palace!
 That will permit you to guard
 against any underground attack!
 Tell everyone that no one is allowed
 on the second floor or above.
 Should an intruder come, I shall
 deal with them personally.
 Likewise, you will not come unless summoned!
 If you disturb me, it will
 have violent consequences!
 The other Ants
 were never allowed on or above the second floor...
 But where do I go now?
 The central stairway connecting the
 first and second floors, I suppose...
 If an intruder comes from underground,
 you will be in position to deal with them.
 Still, the King's been in a bad mood lately.
 Is he upset about losing
 all those Gungi matches?
 I have an idea as to the cause of his irritation.
 My ability, Spiritual Message, would be
 able to confirm my suspicions.
 However, that would be an insult to the King!
 No, I'm just making excuses...
 The truth is that I'm afraid.
 So afraid of what it is
 that grows inside the King even as we speak,
 I cannot bear it...
 Tsk, the rain washed away the scent.
 But now I have the answer.
 The intruder hid here to
 check the second floor,
 but instead of going upstairs, he exited.
 Something made him give up his mission?
 Or did he accomplish his objective?
 No, he may have used his power!
 I should probably warn you...
 If any of you go to the second
 floor, the King will kill you.
 Tell everyone else in the palace.
 Yes, sir.
 Wings!
 What if the intruder has the power to fly?
 The shoes and scent could have
 been there to mislead us.
 He could have flown up to the second floor!
 Youpi-dono...
 Huh?
 Uh, er...
 Pitou is monitoring the palace with En.
 If they'd gone to the second floor,
 they would have been caught...
 Ah, sorry... It's not important.
 Huh?
 That doesn't make sense!
 Then how did the intruder reach the stairway?!
 Youpi-dono...
 Huh? What is it?
 Has Pitou-dono ever ceased to use En?
 For example, that day last week when it rained?
 What? You didn't hear what happened?
 There was a huge uproar...
 The King tore off his own arm!
 Pitou had to heal the King,
 so Pouf was using his En instead.
 How wide is his En?
 I wouldn't know about that...
 Wouldn't it be just as large as Pitou's?
 No, I'd guess that Pouf's En only
 reached as far as the stairway.
 The intruder saw that aura,
 and gave up on ascending!
 That all makes sense.
 The question is what the
 intruder's objective was,
 and whether he's still hiding around here.
 Do I tell Youpi?
 No, I can't do that...
 I should report this to Pitou or Pouf.
 Pouf would be the best choice.
 And if possible, I need to determine
 what the intruder's objective was.
 Otherwise, my report would be
 that the intruder somehow
 made it inside the palace,
 but turned and ran when he felt Pouf's En.
 I won't get any credit.
 I can make up an objective,
 but if the intruder is captured,
 they'll find out I lied.
 But if I tell the Royal Guard my suspicions
 and the intruder is never found,
 it would only waste their time
 and damage my own standing.
 Is that Bizeff's cell phone again?!
 I have a great idea...
 So the intruder captured one of my men.
 According to Leol, that intruder
 has the ability to teleport.
 I believe that he and the
 woman are working together.
 They probably teleported out together.
 Damn, but why would they do that?
 Yes, that's the question.
 However, I've discerned their objective.
 What is it?
 To blow up the palace.
 That's a lie.
 What?
 We must tell the Royal Guard!
 Wait.
 Don't be in such a rush.
 We can tell them after we've found the bomb.
 There's no time!
 Calm down, and consider this
 from their perspective...
 Eh?
 If they want to blow up the palace,
 they'll wait until they're sure the King is here.
 When would that be?
 When all the citizens have assembled...
 Right before the ceremony begins!
 There will be five million humans!
 What a sight that will be to see...
 Just imagine looking down on them!
 The King would not allow a double
 to steal that gratification from him!
 So he will be there in person!
 It's only logical to assume the enemy
 reached the same conclusion.
 True...
 I've stood at the former Supreme Leader's
 side for many of these celebrations...
 The experience brings indescribable
 pleasure beyond even sexual gratification.
 We still have over half a day
 before the ceremony.
 If I use my nose to track the intruder,
 we can find the bomb with time to spare.
 If we have proof when we report to the
 Royal Guard, we'll look much better.
 If we save the King's life, they'll be quite grateful.
 Right?
 Yes... That's true.
 As soon as I find the bomb, I'll contact you.
 Okay, that sounds good.
 The coward finally calmed down?
 I'm getting closer to becoming
 the King behind the scenes!
 Seven minutes to go.
 I'll give a call when it's down to one minute.
 Assemble near the exit then.
 Until then, stand by.
 Meleoron, about your power...
 I know.
 I'll tap your shoulder ten seconds
 before I need to breathe...
 And then, I'll tap you again when
 I start to hold my breath again!
 You don't need to push your limits.
 You should catch your breath
 whenever you need to.
 When God's Accomplice isn't active,
 you can trust me to handle things.
 Why don't you have a smoke?
 If you underestimate their sense
 of smell, you'll die quickly...
 Tracking someone by the smell of
 cigarette smoke is simple for them.
 We could be knocked out the
 second I take my first breath...
 The boss will be putting up a smokescreen
 when we go in. It'll be fine.
 I know, but I'd rather avoid unnecessary risk.
 I don't want to regret my decision.
 The Royal Guard is on the move.
 The three of them gathered above the
 front gate to discuss something.
 Pitou stayed there, and Youpi went back inside.
 Pouf returned to the air to scatter his scales,
 so I don't think anything has changed.
 I'll let you know if anything else happens.
 Yeah, until we leave, feed us as
 much information as you can.
 Essentially, that eliminates the
 possibility of the Royal Guard
 being out of the palace.
 Essentially, but not completely...
 Well, I guarantee that they'll be near the King.
 You can't guarantee anything.
 We have to be prepared for any possibility,
 or we'll be slow to react when
 something goes wrong!
 You only say that because you don't
 understand how loyal they are.
 It's impossible that they'd leave the King!
 The Royal Guard is always with the King!
 And it's fine to believe that!
 But we should prepare for any exceptions!
 Give me an example of one
 of these exceptions!
 There are all kinds of exceptions!
 Honestly, how can they be having
 a dispute at the last second?
 You're being too unrealistic!
 One exception could be a woman...
 Isn't one of the King's objectives to reproduce?
 I wasn't sure what the King was doing in
 the palace, but he was reproducing.
 That must be it.
 I see...
 That would give the King a reason to keep
 the Royal Guard from his bedroom...
 Perhaps Bizeff was bringing
 women in for the King.
 Palm and the King?!
 We're sticking to the plan...
 No matter what's happening to Palm!
 Gon has no idea what they're talking about.
 I'm glad we realized this before we set out.
 If we'd seen something like
 that without warning,
 we'd have frozen in our tracks.
 Get it now?
 You can never overthink something.
 There are probably other unexpected
 situations that we haven't considered yet.
 Yes, something is still bothering me.
 Gon...
 Do you understand?
 Let Palm take care of herself!
 No matter what you see,
 you must stay focused on Pitou.
 Yeah!
 It bothers me, but whether
 a woman's involved or not,
 I believe we should be prepared
 for a third party in the palace.
 I have a feeling that the third party
 is causing my anxiety.
 Why did the King injure himself?
 Hold on...
 That was just a theory of yours.
 Yeah, but you agreed that there
 was no other logical explanation.
 You're contradicting yourself...
 Didn't you say there could be other exceptions?
 Following that logic,
 Pitou could have stopped using En
 for other, unexpected reasons.
 I understand that...
 But something doesn't feel right.
 With three minutes left to go, is this
 something worth thinking about?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, think about it...
 When would you try to hurt yourself?
 When I couldn't forgive myself...
 When you couldn't forgive yourself?
 That's the logical conclusion...
 But that would mean the King
 is a ruler with personal pride,
 and not just a cold tyrant.
 True.
 For the sake of his pride, he's willing to endure pain.
 Speaking from experience,
 people like him will never
 be willing to compromise.
 If the leader refuses to compromise,
 neither will the Royal Guard.
 You should assume that combat
 will be our only option!
 Morel was able to sum everything up...
 But he's wrong.
 The King's self-injury...
 The third party...
 We still haven't correctly
 deduced what happened.
 I have a feeling...
 that the truth has the potential
 to completely ruin our plans!
 It's time!

 At ten seconds left, I'll begin the countdown.

 Charge x And x Invade
 Two minutes before Morel
 issued the call to attack...
 Two men leaped from a giant bird flying high over
 the Republic of East Gorteau.
 Pitou was the first one to notice.
 The only reason Pitou decided to look up
 was ""just because.""
 Pitou's hunch was just that faint.
 Something is coming.
 However, a few seconds later,
 that hunch turned to certainty.
 The enemy.
 But at that point, the enemy was still very high up.
 Too high for even Pitou's
 exceptional senses to ascertain.
 Pitou's decision to prepare for battle
 was based solely on primal instinct.
 Pitou's En...
 has vanished.
 Two of the Royal Guard almost
 simultaneously spotted the approaching form.
 A dragon!
 At the Same Time
 Ten seconds to go.
 Nine!
 Eight!
 Seven.
 As Morel counted down to the attack,
 Killua alone noticed that Gon's eyes sank
 to a deep, dark, silent coldness beside him.
 Six...
 Five.
 Four.
 Three.
 Two.
 This was when Pitou ceased using En,
 in order to prepare for the coming fight.
 However...
 One.
 Go!
 Your Majesty!
 Dragon Meteor Shower
 Dragon Dive
 Dragon Dive.
 The sighting of the enemy
 and the decision to stop using En
 in preparation for battle had backfired.
 Where are they?
 Faced with a serious threat to the King,
 Pitou's six senses, sharpened to their limits,
 immediately focused on the intruders.
 The countless dragons that rained
 down were less significant threats
 than the humans in the sky.
 Terpsichora!
 Puppet Master's Serenity
 Terpsichora
 Pitou uses this Nen ability when
 full power is required to fight.
 It takes less than a tenth of a second
 after activation to launch the attack.
 However, during that fraction of a second,
 Pitou could hear Netero speaking.
 I prepared for a variety of responses.
 But you've made a bad move, little Ant.
 Bad Move
 It really happens.
 You don't think it's possible.
 But it is.
 It's like when your life flashes before your eyes.
 When you know you're about to die, you feel
 as though time slows, and you review your life.
 It's just like that.
 In fact, I'd consider this
 phenomenon even more credible.
 Because you can hear what
 the other person is thinking.
 You can even obtain information
 known only to the other person.
 There is proof that it worked.
 Martial artists call this ""listening with the spirit.""
 Listening with the Spirit
 It's a time perception paradox that occurs
 commonly when two skilled warriors clash.
 The secret behind the old man's strength?
 I can think of a few possibilities.
 First, his Nen is very quiet.
 No one can predict his next
 attack by reading his aura.
 He's lived a long time for a reason.
 He has a plant's mental toughness.
 Hell, he was an old man when
 I was still breast feeding.
 He's the only man to fight my grandpa and survive.
 I'd consider him an acquaintance.
 We are like yin and yang.
 Fool, we aren't evenly matched.
 He always has the upper hand.
 What?
 The secret behind his strength?
 I guess there's also that...
 When it comes to battle,
 he has the Hundred-type Guanyin Bodhisattva.
 That is his most dangerous ability.
 Netero's sequential movements appeared
 exceedingly gradual and fluid to Pitou.
 No
 No...
 There was no doubt that
 Netero's motions had ended
 in the moment between Pitou's Nen
 activation and subsequent attack.
 Essentially, this required the
 constriction of time perception,
 almost to the point of stopping
 time entirely for Pitou alone,
 in order to perceive Netero's actions.
 In other words, the result was...
 an attack that could not be dodged.
 Netero, forty-six years old,
 in the dead of winter.
 Sensing that he had reached his limits
 of both body and technique,
 he spent much time in contemplation
 before he reached an answer.
 Gratitude
 That answer was gratitude.
 Amen...
 He owed a debt to the martial arts
 that had helped him to mature.
 The method he came up with to
 repay that debt as best he could...
 was to throw 10,000 punches of gratitude every day.
 He would calm himself,
 worship,
 pray,
 ready himself,
 then punch.
 At first, completing the sequence
 took five or six seconds.
 On the first day, he required over 18
 hours to complete 10,000 punches.
 Upon completion, he'd fall asleep on the spot.
 When he awoke, he resumed
 punching, day after day.
 After two years, he noticed a difference.
 After he'd completed 10,000 punches,
 the sun was still up.
 At age fifty, he had made a perfect metamorphosis.
 He managed to complete 10,000
 punches of gratitude
 in under an hour.
 This left him more time for prayer.
 When Netero came down from
 the mountains, his fists
 were faster than sound.
 Was that my imagination?
 For a moment, he seemed to disappear...
 I didn't hear anything until after...
 Master?
 La—
 Lady Guanyin...
 So...
 Are you willing to defend your school?
 I offer you my school.
 Please accept me as a student!
 A monster was born.
 Sure, if you give me something to eat.
 This happened over six decades ago.
 Considering where his hands stopped,
 the attack shouldn't come from there...
 How?!
 I hope that you will not return.
 This will force me a long distance away!
 Your Majesty!
 Pouf!
 He can't hear me...
 He's too worried about the King.
 Doctor Blythe!
 By its nature, this ability could
 only be used for healing.
 Doctor Blythe cannot move from
 its initial summoned position.
 Since the puppet is connected to Pitou's tail,
 Pitou must stay within twenty meters.
 That restriction
 kept Pitou in the fight.
 I've stopped?
 Quickly...
 Quickly!

 The moment Killua entered the palace...
 I knew it!
 ...was his reaction.
 He couldn't sense Pitou's En at all,
 and before him stood Youpi, whom nobody had
 expected to encounter on the first floor.
 Despite the fact that they were now
 in a situation that was utterly
 unforeseen in their planning,
 Killua's experience helped him stay calm.
 Who are these guys?
 Where did they come from?
 From Youpi's perspective, too,
 his current situation was an impossibility.
 Youpi immediately ceased all thought.
 I am a shield.
 I protect the King with my body.
 Of the Royal Guard, Youpi alone was
 created from Magical Beasts, not humans.
 Perhaps that was why
 he lacked the self-preservative
 nature of the other two Royal Guard.
 However, that lack also gave him strength.
 The moment Youpi changed
 forms with a belligerent smile,
 Shoot froze at once.
 However, it wasn't because
 Shoot was slow to react.
 If I move any closer, he will attack.
 And if his attack happens to connect with
 the invisible Knuckle and Meleoron...
 In order to draw Youpi's attention toward himself,
 he began to move his cage and floating arms...
 And then it happened.
 This is Dragon Dive!
 Then the old man's friend is...
 Only Killua understood what was happening,
 and it momentarily froze him.
 The shock was even greater to those
 who didn't know what was going on.
 There were only two present,
 Gon and Youpi, who remained focused
 on the enemy that faced them.
 No way!
 Has he lost it?
 You aren't supposed to fight Youpi...
 No, wait.
 Realization came a moment later to Killua,
 and still a few moments later to the others.
 Seriously, even in this situation,
 how did he realize that, and so quickly?
 If Meleoron and Knuckle were to
 be pierced by a Dragon Lance
 while God's Accomplice was
 active, and die instantly,
 would their invisibility cease?
 Or would the Nen remain, leaving them to
 decompose without anyone ever knowing?
 No one knew the answer.
 Assuming the latter, confirming whether they
 were still alive would be impossible.
 Meaning that, in the worst-case
 scenario, someone else would
 have to deal with Youpi.
 That should have been my job...
 Gon!
 Shoot did nothing wrong.
 Even I was later than Killua
 in noticing and reacting.
 Shoot, don't blame yourself...
 Pull yourself together!
 If Gon and Killua are taking Youpi,
 you're left with Pitou!
 However,
 Shoot was feeling a completely
 different emotion at that moment.
 Gon!
 I want to tell the entire world...
 ""This is Gon!
 A boy less than half my age,
 to whom I owe my life.""
 I've always gone to any lengths
 to avoid facing danger and risk,
 hiding myself within a safe cage,
 where no one could hurt me.
 I hated myself for it...
 But I couldn't change myself.
 Friends and teachers encouraged me,
 but I never truly listened,
 considering it the logic of the strong.
 Yet somehow...
 A boy with less than half my strength
 managed to break my cage!
 Shoot did indeed tend to shrink
 back weakly from opportunity.
 I will survive...
 So that I can thank you!
 However, even he didn't realize that
 such unique turns in his train of thought
 made him shine in the face of adversity.
 Good!
 Knuckle and Meleoron...
 ...are alive!
 What?
 Who was it that just attacked me?
 I couldn't see a thing...
 Did someone fire a projectile from my blind spot?
 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, activate!
 Naturally, they had already tested
 to confirm that God's Accomplice
 would be compatible with Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.
 As long as God's Accomplice stayed active,
 Youpi would be unable to see APR.
 Thus, it was natural that Youpi would question
 what had just happened, rather than
 concentrate on the enemies before him.
 I can't sense any damage or abnormal effect.
 Which means my focus right now should be...
 So far, everything had proceeded
 according to the Hunters' plan.
 However, after a successful first strike,
 Knuckle could only shudder.
 Seriously?
 It's like his aura is unlimited!
 After surviving over five thousand battles,
 Knuckle had the experience and intuition
 to quantify his opponent's strength.
 It was not uncommon for him to
 face enemies who were stronger
 than previous opponents he had encountered.
 However, there was no comparing
 the power he now faced
 to that of the opponents who had come before.
 A monster with an immense amount of aura.
 Five times what the boss has?
 Ten times?
 More?
 I can't tell!
 He had never experienced anything like this.
 Assuming he's ten times stronger,
 with 700,000 aura,
 how long will it take before he goes bust?
 The King!
 That was when
 the Hunters felt
 the full brunt of Pitou's sinister aura.
 Youpi immediately noticed
 that momentary hesitation.
 Your Majesty!
 Your Majesty!
 Since Pitou lacked wings,
 the only option was to continue free falling.
 This was actually a stroke of luck.
 Had there been unlimited courses of action,
 Pitou would have joined Pouf and
 rushed straight toward the King,
 a Royal Guard's natural reaction.
 In that scenario, it's unlikely
 that Pitou would have had
 the presence of mind to use En.
 As a result...
 The guest room on the second
 floor of the west tower...
 The King is with the woman with closed eyes.
 They're also using En to locate the King!
 This was when Pitou realized the
 seriousness of the situation.
 In that instant, Pitou crouched like the
 four-legged creature of the Ant's origin,
 with upper legs tensing like steel
 until they were twice as large as they'd
 been before the attack on Kite.
 In order to reach the King
 before the enemy could.
 But a second later...
 A wave of negative energy from Pitou's destination
 was strong enough to make
 Pitou regret the decision.
 This is...
 the King's...
 The aura coming from the King
 was so unmasked, his current state
 of mind was plain to read.
 As a result, Pitou could only conclude
 that the situation had grown
 even worse than previously thought.
 The main stairway had collapsed!
 When the King looked down,
 time began to move again.
 However, time remained frozen for everyone else.
 The intruders, who had come for the King's life,
 were holding their breath and standing still
 because of the girl covered in blood.
 And because the grotesque
 creature holding her body
 was clearly treating her with tenderness and care.
 Pitou.
 Y-Yes, sir.
 The expression on the King's face
 had returned to normal.
 This only increased Pitou's concern.
 Heal Komugi.
 I'm counting on you.
 The two veterans continued to stand by,
 silently watching their enemies,
 out of respect.
 This was an act of love for a life.
 Should they infringe upon that act,
 their cause was lost.
 It would have been inhumane.
 This isn't what I was given to expect.
 For Zeno to make that comment was only natural.
 Netero felt the same way.
 Not here.
 Let us go elsewhere.
 I believe that a different location
 would be to your benefit, as well.
 Netero had spent a great deal of money
 to enlist Zeno to help separate
 the King from the Royal Guard.
 He had no reason to object to the King's proposal.
 However...
 Well, I suppose.
 He could not help but feel
 he had lost the initiative...
 Doctor Blythe.
 The moment Pitou's ability was activated,
 the two men thought that their decision
 to lower their guard would prove fatal.
 Because the King was able to walk
 between them with ease.
 Their opponent, also, was an incredible monster.

 Oh, it's candy. Gummy insects.

 An x Indebted x Insect
 Youpi's attack separated the Hunters.
 The central stairway was destroyed,
 with Youpi awaiting anyone still looking to ascend.
 Behind him were Knuckle and Meleoron,
 who had barely managed to
 make it to the second floor.
 Below,
 the ones hit at closest range
 by Youpi's attack were Shoot...
 This is bad.
 My leg's destroyed.
 Shoot!
 ...and Morel.
 The rest is up to you.
 Knuckle...
 He couldn't say Knuckle's name out loud.
 Stupid tricks!
 One attack by Youpi
 tore apart the Deep Purple puppets,
 but Morel had deliberately
 positioned them with that in mind.
 They were just decoys?
 That resistance...
 This is more than smoke!
 The weapon was the only
 thing that wasn't smoke?
 Fool! You won't get away!
 After using his own weapon as a decoy,
 Morel had no option left but to run.
 But...
 Knuckle knew exactly what he had to do.
 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy!
 That...
 That punch was meant to send
 him flying over the horizon.
 The total is 590?
 Ten seconds feels like an eternity now...
 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy applies additional damage
 in the form of interest as time progresses
 from the activation of the ability.
 Lost sight of him...
 Damn you!
 The enraged Youpi
 returned to his senses because his multiple
 eyes had caught sight of a shadowed form.
 With his right leg broken,
 Shoot unconsciously used his remaining
 leg to stand on one of his own fists.
 Despite that he had never attempted it before,
 Shoot realized that this was his ultimate technique.
 And he had no clear reason
 to cover his right eye.
 He was just enjoying the fact
 that he continued to gain strength
 while the situation deteriorated.
 Fueled by adversity itself,
 Shoot took flight.
 His tremendous speed and vigor
 succeeded in forcing Youpi to
 concentrate on defense for a few seconds.
 All in order
 to help the others.
 Shoot, Knuckle...
 Once we finish this, first thing we do
 is drink ourselves silly with good alcohol.
 That's the only way I can get you guys
 to let me give you a big hug.
 The debris cloud raised by the destruction
 was the perfect cover for Morel to expand
 his smoke aura throughout the palace
 so he could monitor the course of the battle.
 Morel's objective was the throne room.
 When Youpi destroyed the central stairway,
 Gon and Killua evaded the attack
 and changed direction.
 They planned to jump from
 the east tower's second floor to the central
 tower's third floor, where the throne room was.
 Upon hitting the ground, they passed
 Ikalgo in the courtyard as he headed
 for the elevator underground.
 His ability that let him control corpses
 like part of his own body,
 Living Dead Dolls, granted him
 the use of multiple sets of eyes,
 which had allowed him to
 dodge Dragon Dive unscratched.
 In the corner of his eye, Killua spotted
 two soldier Ants in the direction
 that Ikalgo was headed.
 In the next moment, Killua had taken off.
 Killua?
 Why is he heading toward the elevator?
 What am I doing?
 What's wrong with me?
 It was only natural that Killua would
 be surprised by his own actions.
 He was the one
 who had instructed the others
 to stick to their own tasks.
 At that point, Killua's mind completely froze.
 However, while his mind panicked,
 his body continued to move efficiently,
 keeping aura usage to a minimum,
 while swiftly and accurately
 gauging the two soldier Ants' abilities
 and movements, and halting them.
 Only Ikalgo and one other
 saw what had happened.
 Damn...
 What have I
 done?
 Killua,
 I owe you one.
 After he realized what he'd done,
 a tangle of emotions
 had left Killua lost in confusion,
 until Ikalgo's words woke him.
 By the time the two Ants' remains hit the floor,
 Killua was already moving on.
 Flutter?
 Something's wrong.
 At either end of the hall leading to the
 elevator underground were the servant quarters,
 which soldier Ants currently occupied.
 Ikalgo raced past the two Ants,
 and at the moment when he reached the elevator,
 the doors at both ends opened simultaneously.
 From the doors appeared...
 Cheetu...
 Brovada!
 After seeing Flutter,
 Welfin had hidden because he'd smelled
 that something was wrong.
 That was too fast.
 Once they spotted the enemy,
 the two soldiers raised an alert.
 Right afterward, they were killed.
 The time between the intruder's
 return down the hallway
 and Flutter's appearance was too short!
 Which means they must have passed
 one another in the hallway.
 Then why were the soldiers killed,
 but not Flutter?
 Is Flutter on the enemy's side?
 Meaning...
 He's a traitor!
 Is he acting on his own, or...
 Is it Hagya's... Or rather...
 Leol's orders?
 This is pathetic.
 When he needed me most, I wasn't there.
 And I call myself a Royal Guard?
 I don't even know where the King is.
 And I call myself a Royal Guard?
 No.
 I am a failure!
 It's that simple...
 Pouf's loyalty made him both strong and weak.
 The ideals he prioritized were
 unyielding and absolute.
 Pouf, the former Royal Guard.
 Now, Pouf...
 Useless Pouf...
 You utter fool.
 You failure of a Royal Guard!
 Where will you go now?
 You have no idea?
 And if the King isn't there,
 then you'll be more useless
 than scum, won't you?
 No, useless Pouf...
 You just refuse to accept reality.
 You don't want him spending
 time with that woman!!!!
 You don't want him spending
 time with that woman!
 His emotions were directed at
 the King as well as himself.
 An absolute King,
 feeling concern for a lowly human...
 Visiting the room of a lowly human by choice...
 It is unforgivable!
 But...
 That's probably where the King is...
 Before I came here, I knew that much.
 I didn't fail as a Royal Guard because
 I didn't know the King's location.
 I failed because I knew where,
 and I didn't go there!
 Yes, Pouf, you traitor, lower than scum.
 You are now a mere bug!
 You can no longer expect anything of yourself.
 Nor are you allowed, then,
 to expect anything of the King!
 I can only work for the King...
 For the King... For the King...
 For the King... For the King...
 For the King! For the King! For the King!
 For the King!
 For the King!
 Instead, his emotions, bordering on fanaticism,
 prevented him from thinking clearly in the
 seconds after he arrived in the throne room.
 I must go to the King.
 Yo.
 You're gonna ignore me?!
 He goes straight to the King without a glance.
 Unfortunately, you've been surrounded.
 What must I do
 to have you let me out?
 Oh, I'm not letting you out.
 I see...

 You took advantage of the chaos in the palace
 in order to separate my Royal Guard from me.
 It makes no difference.
 Proceed.
 Dragon Head!
 He is frightening...
 The technique he unleashed was
 not intended to hurt the King.
 And both of them could tell that the King
 realized this at once.
 Zeno made certain that his Nen
 was completely neutral.
 Was it a gesture of respect? Or was it...
 Killua...
 Pitou is over there.
 Let's go!
 Let's go...
 In what sense did you mean that?
 Killua barely managed to stop himself
 from asking the question.
 If I ask that question,
 I won't be able to stop anymore...
 I won't be able to go back.
 If Killua would just ask, he would have his answer.
 Anyone with enough experience
 would easily arrive at that next step.
 But the fear of losing someone he cared for
 prevented him from taking that step.
 A few moments before the dragon took flight,
 Cheetu and Brovada appeared
 before Ikalgo.
 Hey, it's Flutter.
 What's with all the noise?
 Pitou-dono's En disappeared again.
 I just returned...
 It seems the enemy is attacking.
 Seriously?
 Well, I couldn't imagine anything else causing this.
 What happened to your wings?
 Oh, uh...
 I lost them earlier, during the attack.
 Are you going underground?
 Y-Yeah, I have orders from Hagya-sama.
 What should we do?
 Well, we weren't told to defend this place...
 But I'm just itching to try
 my new technique.
 It's huge...
 That looks fun!
 I'm gonna check it out!
 Be careful!
 I'm gonna see what's going on!
 Then, I'll be going.
 Okay.
 ""Hagya-sama""?
 Meanwhile, in the throne room,
 in the central tower...
 Is it truly possible
 to trap me in one place?
 Why don't we find out?
 Wing scales...
 Knov said that they can hypnotize people.
 I don't want to inhale any...
 You seem to be finished talking.
 I would expect that of anyone
 with considerable power.
 However...
 Caution, resolve,
 and confidence in a 2:3:5 ratio.
 His caution isn't as strong
 because he's confident.
 It's safe to say he has a strong personality.
 Pouf's Spiritual Message
 surrounds his opponent with wing scales,
 making their aura more opaque,
 letting him sense their state of mind.
 I suppose I should introduce myself.
 I am Shaiapouf, one of the King's Royal Guard.
 His caution has increased slightly.
 You won't tell me your name?
 If you believe that I'm trying
 to trick you into inhaling my wing
 scales, you're sadly mistaken.
 And to be honest, I'm a little shocked.
 After a rebirth, all will be forgotten.
 I'll need you to wait a moment.
 If he wants to waste time, that's fine by me.
 No matter what sort of beast he emerges as...
 Shoot was fighting recklessly,
 without concern for his life,
 which turned out to be the
 reason he was still alive.
 Hotel Rafflesia...
 While barely dodging multiple attacks that
 would have been otherwise lethal,
 Shoot had only managed to take
 the eye on Youpi's shoulder.
 He had essentially done no damage.
 However...
 Youpi was unable to finish off his opponent.
 The strange sensation that his momentum
 was being stolen, rather than stopped,
 influenced Youpi's mental state tremendously.
 After taking multiple hits from
 attacks he didn't understand,
 Youpi was backing up.
 I can't let this guy near the King.
 Every second I keep him away
 from the King counts.
 Youpi and Shoot shared the same objective.
 However, this expected turn of events
 was difficult on Knuckle...
 Hold it in...
 I can't attack now!
 If I attack now, I'll be broadcasting
 that there's one more enemy
 he needs to worry about!
 Hold it in!
 Shoot was now covered in blood,
 as he endured Youpi's ferocious
 barrage of attacks.
 Forced to watch from the sidelines,
 just remaining hidden was a battle.
 No matter how he told himself to keep still...
 Hold it in... Please hold it in!
 Knuckle was unable to hold back the
 tears streaming down his face.
 You can do it!
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Only ten seconds have passed?
 You're kidding!
 How much longer do I have to endure
 this suffocating, excruciating wait
 that makes me want to do nothing but run away?
 This must be some kind of joke...
 And it isn't funny!
 I can't hold it in any longer!
 Knuckle's rampage was halted
 by the first tap from Meleoron.
 Seriously?! It's only been ten seconds!
 But that just might have saved me.
 Meleoron wasn't trying to help Knuckle.
 He, too, had reached his limit.
 Crap!
 Uh-oh.
 He barely scratched me, but it
 was enough damage
 to offset the interest and
 my full-strength attack.
 Shoot is risking his life out there,
 while I'm standing here unhurt,
 and making stupid mistakes!
 Youpi felt no sensation of scratching anything,
 nor did he notice APR's declaration
 of returned interest.
 Damn!
 He couldn't hear Knuckle's scream, either.
 Calm down, you fool...
 You're gonna ruin everything.
 Here's the distance where we want to stay...
 Not close enough for him to find us,
 but close enough to get in fast.
 He'll notice APR for a second,
 but that's no problem.
 Shoot's fighting hard,
 so go ahead and catch your breath, Meleoron.
 God's Accomplice...
 Undo.
 What is this thing?
 When did it show up?
 No, it can't be that I didn't notice it.
 It just suddenly appeared.
 Was I hit by an attack?
 No, I wasn't.
 A delayed effect?
 So it must have been then!
 Does that mean the condition
 was met during the fight?
 What is this number?
 Is it a countdown? A bomb?
 No, the number isn't going up or down.
 This is too much of a pain!
 I only need to destroy the source!
 Something's coming.
 Despite his overwhelming power,
 one reason Youpi was unable to defeat Shoot
 was the evident difference in
 skill level between them.
 It's fast... I can't get away!
 One skewered chunk of meat coming up!
 He hit himself to accelerate.
 Very well...
 That was close.
 The reaction to the attack told Youpi
 that he could win at any moment.
 Youpi wasn't the kind of fighter to rely on strategy,
 so this spurred him on.
 Youpi's analysis was on the mark.
 It was true that Youpi was
 increasingly likely to win this fight.
 If he made any mistake, it was not realizing
 that Shoot was fine with this fact.
 I can keep going...
 I...
 can still fly.
 I'm not done...
 However, quietly and surely...
 Shoot was reaching his limit.
 Hey, Youpi!
 Over here, fool!
 Knuckle!
 I'm telling him that there's one
 more enemy to worry about?
 That's fine.
 That will serve to distract Youpi,
 and it will save Shoot.

 Knuckle decided to show himself.

 ""Hagya-sama.""
 Ikalgo didn't realize that the name
 he had spoken with full confidence
 had aroused Welfin and Brovada's suspicions,
 as he headed beneath the palace
 to search for Palm.
 Satellite Dragonflies!
 Ikalgo knew Palm only through the
 information he had been given.
 However, he was already firm in his resolve
 that he wouldn't leave the palace without finding her.
 I'm gonna rescue her.
 Palm is a friend of a friend.
 That makes her a friend...
 My friend!
 Palm was risking her life.
 That fact alone had earned Ikalgo's respect.
 I'm not doing this out of duty or obligation.
 I want to help her...
 Because I decided I would help her!
 The elevator leading underground
 was equipped with a security camera and a scale.
 After arriving underground,
 it would confirm that there was nothing inside
 before automatically returning to the surface.
 Any number of people could descend at once,
 but only one could ascend at a time.
 And a pass code had to be entered.
 The eight-digit code varied per person,
 and could be used to identify
 who had used the elevator.
 If the user's height and weight
 do not match the data
 on record from the time the code
 was assigned, a warning sounded,
 and the elevator became a prison.
 On the first entry of an incorrect code,
 a warning sounded, and the doors locked.
 Should an incorrect code be entered three times, security was alerted,
 the elevator filled with sleeping gas,
 and the violator was captured and tortured.
 In other words, a third error meant death.
 Both the violator and the code's
 original owner would be killed,
 making one's code as valuable as one's own life.
 And the only code holders
 able to use the elevator without
 any such restriction
 were Bizeff and Marcos.
 That was because the elevator
 was a more convenient means
 of smuggling in various things, including humans,
 than the cargo entrance,
 which was watched by soldiers.
 What is this smell?!
 Has Flutter been living in the morgue?
 I can also smell Bro, since he was
 the last one in here before me.
 Damn, there's something else, very faint...
 The stench of Flutter's decomposing body served
 to dull Welfin's sense of smell.
 Since Bro followed Flutter underground,
 he must have also noticed that Flutter
 used the name ""Hagya-sama.""
 Or is Brovada conspiring with him?
 When I was watching the intruder,
 was Bro watching me from behind?
 If he was, and if he's working with the intruder,
 then he must have seen that
 I noticed Flutter's odd behavior...
 So, he went down first...
 In order to ambush me!
 Damn, this is my chance!
 Flutter was clearly acting suspiciously.
 If I can pass him off him as the
 bomb threat's perpetrator,
 Bizeff will be indebted to me!
 Bizeff!
 Where's Bizeff?
 This is bad...
 If he dies during the attack,
 my plans will be ruined!
 Forget Flutter... First, I need to find Bizeff!
 Yo.

 He's changed.
 My job here is done.
 I know nothing beyond the mission I received.
 I'll let you draw your own conclusions
 about what's happening inside.

 Swallowing the words he wanted to say,
 Zeno disappeared into the darkness.
 Meanwhile, near the wrecked central stairway,
 Knuckle has revealed himself, a move
 that was not part of the original plan.
 Meleoron and Shoot
 could only hold their breaths.

 trust you again until you're dead!
 I'm already running out of breath... Do I run?
 Which way do I go?
 What if he goes the same way?
 Do I wait for him to leave?
 Can I hold my breath that much longer?
 No... I can't hold it!
 I'm at my limit!
 I'll have to exhale and inhale in one swift act!
 Perfect Plan, undo!
 Now inhale...
 Activate!
 For a second, I sensed something.
 The enemy?
 Welfin's power reflected his very nature,
 channeling his suspicion into an effective weapon.
 Egg Man
 Missile Man
 Missile Man!
 If anyone's hiding behind the building,
 surrender and show yourself by
 the time I count down from three!
 If you don't, I'll attack!
 Three!
 Two!
 One!
 Fire!
 No one's there... Did I imagine it?
 To use Missile Man, Welfin identifies his target
 and loads ammo in the form
 of questions or commands.
 If someone answers falsely or disobeys,
 the attack is launched.
 By the time Welfin noticed a presence,
 Meleoron had already moved.
 Had Meleoron stayed in the same place,
 his attack would have succeeded,
 despite his inability to detect his target.
 Finding nothing fitting the target's
 description, the attack failed.
 Once fired, Missile Man will
 pursue its target until it hits.
 No one can survive the impact.
 However, Welfin understood that
 his ability wasn't omnipotent.
 His power was nothing more than a tool.
 Welfin was even skeptical of his own power.
 He sought to become the king behind the scenes,
 because being the real king would mean
 he'd have too much to be suspicious of.
 It was my imagination?
 No, wait...
 I smell odorless deodorant...
 You can't fool my nose.
 Someone was here! I know it!
 Since I could only sense them for a moment,
 they must be very skilled.
 The use of deodorant confirms
 that they're aware of my nose.
 This confirms that there are traitors among us!
 There are others besides Flutter?
 The answer is probably yes!
 And it's someone I know...
 That's why they're hiding their scent.
 Who is it?
 They don't want to fight me?
 Because they can take me out at any time?
 Do I...
 Do I...
 Do I really
 want to stay on the Chimera Ants' side?
 Should I really be
 searching for Bizeff now?

 If I pass out,
 Hotel Rafflesia will stop...
 Every little bit of damage counts...
 I can still fight...
 I can still...
 Right now, my job...
 isn't to help Shoot!
 It's to use my power to help the others,
 so they can complete their
 missions as fast as possible!
 Though it broke his heart,
 Meleoron had to leave the two Hunters
 and follow Gon and Killua instead,
 in order to fulfill his mission.
 Meanwhile, Ikalgo proceeded further into
 the depths of the palace to rescue Palm.
 Satellite Dragonflies!
 I'm gonna rescue her.
 Palm is a friend of a friend.
 That makes her a friend...
 My friend!
 As Morel, the first Hunter
 to reach the throne room,
 waited to continue his battle with Pouf,
 who remained in his cocoon,
 Netero and the King were leaving the palace,
 and Gon and Killua had finally located Neferpitou,
 their target for avenging Kite.
 Revenge x And x Recovery
 Do you
 remember me?
 I'm Gon Freecss!
 I came here
 to get Kite back from you!
 Pitou didn't hear a single word Gon said.
 The only thing on Pitou's mind was
 surviving the current threat
 while carrying out the King's order.
 Every cell in Pitou's body was focused on that task.
 I must protect Komugi...
 At any cost!
 Something's not right.
 Watching from a short distance, Killua
 noticed that something was strange.
 Why isn't the enemy preparing for
 battle when we're right here?
 I can't sense any aura at all...
 Pitou might as well be completely
 naked... Utterly defenseless.
 Does Pitou think it can win without aura?
 No, that isn't possible.
 The aura coming from Gon now
 doesn't even compare to his usual.
 Even Pitou can't fight that without using Nen.
 Is it because of where we are?
 Does Pitou believe that, at this distance,
 there'll be time to activate Nen if we do attack?
 That's possible.
 However, for some reason...
 That doesn't seem to be it.
 It almost looks like...
 That's it.
 It looks like...
 a mother
 using its own body to guard something weaker.
 That's ridiculous.
 Pitou isn't someone who's capable of that!
 But then, why did Grandpa...
 I'll let you draw your own conclusions
 about what's happening inside.
 ...say something that cryptic?
 While Killua was fighting his natural instincts,
 the girl lying before them brought back
 images of a broken Kite to Gon's mind.
 Get away from her.
 I'm telling you to take that
 monster and get away from her.
 And then, fight me!
 Fight me, so I can get Kite back!
 The act of placing both palms face-up
 to display one's lack of malice
 was a gesture Killua recognized...
 Please
 wait.
 What the hell?!
 What am I supposed to wait for?
 Get up! We're going outside!
 Pitou's unexpected lack of resistance
 left Gon without a target for his rage.
 Meanwhile, Killua was close to fully
 understanding the current situation.
 It was...
 I know nothing beyond the mission I received.
 He was saying something
 unexpected happened!
 Grandpa knew nothing when
 he brought the dragon down.
 Grandpa's mission was probably
 to use Dragon Dive and Dragon Head to
 separate the King and Royal Guard.
 But he didn't know that she was here, too.
 Wait, this woman must be
 the third party that none of us knew about!
 And she's most likely
 the reason the King hurt himself.
 Why would the King do something
 so out of character?
 Because she is someone
 who's special to the King.
 Pitou isn't taking her apart.
 Pitou is healing her at the King's command!
 Pitou isn't only prevented from using
 En when healing someone.
 All aura must be focused on
 healing ability when using it.
 However, Killua knew that this
 information would only have
 a negative effect on Gon.
 What do I do?
 What do I tell him?
 Go—
 I'll do anything!
 I'll do anything you say!
 So please wait.
 I...
 must save this person!
 Save...
 Save what?
 ""Anything""?
 When you say ""anything""...
 Killua...
 I'm asking the questions.
 What is it that you must save?
 Amidst the extreme tension,
 the answer Pitou chose to give was...
 This person is someone...
 Someone who's important
 to someone important to me.
 ...the truth.
 She is the reason the King is who he is.
 If she dies, the King will cease to be who he is.
 She's that important.
 So...
 All I care about is saving her!
 Once she's healed, I'll do anything you want.
 So please wait!
 You want to save her?
 You must save her?
 Save her?
 How dare you say that...
 How dare you?!
 Damn it!
 The hell if...
 The hell if I'll listen to you!
 Gon, hold on!
 It's likely that we were
 the ones that injured her.
 It was probably Grandpa's Dragon Dive.
 And?
 Pitou is probably telling the
 truth about healing her.
 So?
 Let's wait until it's done.
 ""Likely""?
 ""Probably""?
 You want me to wait because
 of ""likely"" and ""probably""?
 And after we wait, it's likely that this thing
 will do what I want?
 Likely? Probably?
 Seriously?!
 That's crap!
 That's just crap!
 Is something wrong with you?!
 You want... You want me to trust this thing?!
 I can't do that!
 If you want, you may also have my right arm...
 If that isn't enough,
 you can take both legs...
 If you're worried I'll change my mind
 after the healing finishes,
 you can break any part of my body
 that isn't required to heal her.
 Please let me save her!
 That isn't fair...
 That isn't fair, damn it!
 Why are you helping her,
 after everything you did to Kite?!
 Gon!
 Why?!
 Why?!
 To hell with that.
 First comes—
 Gon, if you kill Pitou,
 we'll never get Kite back.
 You have it easy, Killua.
 You're perfectly calm.
 Since it means nothing to you...
 I'm only saying this because
 you're out of control.
 Did you forget the first thing
 you said when we came here?
 We're here to get Kite back!
 Pull it together!
 Yeah.
 I'm okay now.
 How long?
 How long do I have to wait?
 To completely heal her
 will take three to four hours.
 No, I can't wait that long.
 If I have an hour,
 I can heal her most critical injuries.
 Please give me that.
 In one hour, you're coming with
 me to Peijing, to heal Kite.
 Can you promise me that?
 I swear to keep that promise!
 I'll wait right here for one hour.
 Next time: Insult x And x Payback.
 I can't think of anything right now...
 Killua, insult me back!
 I... feel better now.

117,"Why?!
 You have it easy, Killua.
 You're perfectly calm.
 Since it means nothing to you...
 Gon's cry had guided
 Meleoron to the two boys.
 Insult x And x Payback
 I'm going to have to refuse.
 Right now, I'm not in the mood.
 Come on, don't say that.
 Just think of it as bad luck that I found you!
 Let me test my new technique on you.
 That hurts, man...
 You don't have to give me such a dirty look.
 The one I really want to fight
 is someone else, you know.
 That guy with sunglasses,
 carrying the big pipe.
 Aren't you with him?
 Then, why don't you go and find him?
 I know where he is.
 But I can't get to him.
 He controls smoke, and he's hidden
 himself behind a smokescreen.
 And I can't get through.
 I climbed up to the roof, to see
 if I could get in from above...
 And I happened to spot you.
 So I'm supposed to be the warm-up
 before your main fight?
 Bingo!
 I've had it for today...
 Will you listen to what I have to say?
 For the first time since taking
 over the family business,
 I may have killed someone who wasn't my target.
 Dude, my technique is awesome!
 Don't be too shocked when you see it.
 Well, you'll still be shocked in the end...
 You're a self-centered fellow.
 Doesn't look like I'll be able to
 persuade you to let me go.
 Bingo and bingo!
 You should watch your back.
 What an old trick!
 I won't fall for that!
 Your buddy told me to keep
 my eyes on my opponeâ€”
 Well, the result would have
 been the same either way.
 Should I have spared him?
 Not necessary.
 How's Killua doing?
 Hmm? He's matured.
 And I believe that he's removed Illumi's needle.
 I see.
 Oh, that's right...
 I had a rare experience today.
 My time was compressed!
 I must remember to ignore
 half of everything you say.
 Okay, we should be safe here.
 Explain what's going on.
 God's Accomplice... Undo!
 Shoot's out of the battle,
 and Knuckle is fighting Youpi alone.
 I need your help...
 Knuckle's going to keep running,
 to try and buy time.
 He's crazy!
 Okay, what's the minimum length of time
 you can maintain God's Accomplice?
 The first time, I was so nervous, I failed
 and had to tap out after ten seconds.
 But I've regained my cool.
 If I don't move, I can hold my
 breath for at least a minute!
 That's plenty of time.
 I just need one chance.
 Approximately three minutes
 before Killua raised his finger...
 Knuckle was airborne.
 In Knuckle's own opinion, his strongest
 point was his ability to run away.
 Once, to help his friends escape,
 he knocked out a cop,
 and eluded four patrol cars and dozens
 of police for a full day and night, on foot.
 The day he finally escaped was the day
 he graduated from grade school.
 His stamina when maintaining top speed
 far exceeds that of a cheetah.
 To save Shoot, Knuckle had chosen
 to reveal himself and use an out-boxing
 strategy against Youpi.
 For the most part, it was the right choice.
 He stopped chasing me?
 If there was one thing he miscalculated,
 it was his opponent's intentions.
 Shoot's in trouble! Crap!
 Shoot and Knuckle considered
 Youpi a high-priority target.
 But Youpi wasn't as focused on them.
 As a Royal Guard, protecting the
 King was his mission.
 His focus was on keeping enemies from the King.
 Youpi still believed the King
 to be in the throne room.
 And since guarding the stairway
 was his assignment,
 he was convinced that Pitou and
 Pouf were protecting the King.
 So his main priority was to keep enemies
 away from the throne room.
 Since he didn't know how
 many enemies there were,
 the nature of his opponent's
 ability took second priority.
 As did any enemies running or dying.
 They did not warrant his concern.
 Hey! Pitou!
 Shoot!
 Shoot was still alive.
 Shoot...
 Given their positions, when Youpi turned back,
 he must have spotted Shoot.
 Then we aren't even worth...
 finishing off?
 Youpi didn't care if Shoot lived or died.
 After having fought him with all they had,
 the pair had never felt so humiliated.
 Are Shoot
 and I
 no more than flies?!
 Fine, then!
 You're gonna regret this!
 In a few more minutes,
 this fly will send you flying!
 Pitou! Pouf!
 Are you there?
 The boss used Smoky Jail on the throne room.
 That means he and Pouf are alone inside.
 The King isn't in the throne room!
 Say something! Can't you hear me?
 Hey!
 You fool...
 You're free to defend an empty throne room!
 I'll take Shoot, and watch from a safe distance.
 Damn it...
 By the time Knuckle realized his mistake,
 he had already made another.
 Shoot and Youpi must have seen one another.
 Shoot must have been prepared
 to die at that moment.
 That's the kind of fight we came for.
 But he ignored Shoot...
 When Knuckle pictured the
 expression on Youpi's face
 after he'd glanced at the bloody Shoot
 and headed up to the third floor,
 Knuckle realized his new mistake.
 Damn it.
 Damn it...
 Am I supposed to ignore the fact
 that my buddy's been humiliated?
 For what reason?
 For the world?
 For humanity?
 And if our mission succeeds,
 I just shake Shoot's hand and say,
 ""We did it""?
 Pat each other's shoulders and laugh?
 Even though he was humiliated?
 I can't do that!
 That isn't right...
 C-Come on...
 Oh, sorry.
 And while I'm apologizing, I need
 you to wait here a little longer!
 I need to punch that guy in the face...
 And I'll throw another punch for you!
 It's my job to stay calm and stop Knuckle...
 ""Have you lost your mind?
 Don't go.
 Just keep your mouth shut, and buy more time.""
 That is my...
 Do it, Knuckle!
 Damn it!
 That bastard...
 He...
 He...
 looked at me like I was trash!
 Give that bastard an extra punch for me...
 Yeah, I got it!
 Sorry, master...
 We're both fools.
 There's something more important
 than the world right now!
 Knuckle's new mistake
 was a misjudgment of his priorities.
 My attacks aren't having any
 effect on this smoke...
 Your Majesty!
 Pitou! Pouf!
 Are you there? Hey!
 Is that Youpi?
 Were they both defeated?
 I hope the old man's doing okay...
 Why isn't Pouf responding?
 Something's wrong.
 Why is he staying inside his cocoon?
 I would have expected him to be in
 more of a hurry to get to the King.
 Could we have made...
 some kind of mistake about the Royal Guard?
 Is our operation actually working?
 Don't think about it!
 I'm here to fulfill my mission!
 Doubt, worry, impatience...
 Negative emotions are growing,
 but his resolve has not faltered.
 Just as I would expect from a strong fighter.
 I'm impressed.
 However, that will be the constraint
 that weakens your decision-making.
 Damn...
 Why is Pitou's En gone?
 Have the King, Pitou, and Pouf all vanished?
 Leaving me behind?
 What happened?
 What's going on?
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Shut up!
 The black fog on my shoulder won't go away.
 And the number on this thing keeps increasing.
 I have to find the King!
 Damn, I should have killed the fly downstairs.
 That might have gotten rid of this fog.
 But I have to find the King!
 What's going on?!
 I'm getting annoyed!
 Yo.
 What the hell is wrong with all of you?!
 And with that shout, Youpi transformed.
 It was drastic enough to make Knuckle,
 who thought he had come prepared,
 instantly switch from an offensive
 stance to an evasive one.
 This manifestation of evil
 clearly meant only to destroy.
 Hang on!
 Did you...
 hit him?
 Eh?
 Did you hit him...
 for me?
 Not yet, damn it!
 I'll hit him hard, so hold on!
 But we have to run, so we don't die first!
 For the first time in his life,
 Youpi had endured an excessive amount of stress.
 This had made it apparent that
 his power was not meant for guarding the King.
 Rather, he realized that his violent rage
 could fuel a rapid increase in the
 mass of both his body and his aura.
 The destruction brought him great pleasure,
 after which his body rapidly shrank,
 and he felt a strong sense of loss.
 Knuckle's superior experience helped him
 understand what had happened to Youpi.
 We can win.
 That was a powerful blast.
 I doubt it'll be easy to goad him
 into doing that on purpose,
 and make it out unharmed.
 But the return for taking that risk
 will be enormous.
 I make him mad, so he blows up.
 The perfect time to hit him
 would be when he's charging up.
 And the aura required to fuel his explosion
 will cause him to go bankrupt sooner.
 The plan Knuckle formed on the spot
 was almost flawless for dealing
 with the berserk Youpi.
 However, Youpi's true worth only
 became clear after the explosion.
 As Youpi transitioned between
 lingering pleasure and despondency,
 this selfish ability that could be
 called the dregs of his ego
 was focused solely on how he could use
 this power for the King's sake.
 Selflessness...
 His Ant instincts and Magical Beast mentality
 continued to function calmly even after
 the discovery of his burst of emotion.
 My contribution to the King will be
 how well I can control this ability
 without letting my emotions take over.
 In other words,
 I must use it to destroy the intruders.
 Now that Youpi had learned how
 to be both enraged and composed,
 the risk for Knuckle was overly great.
 Approximately three minutes have
 passed since the mission began.
 The intentions of all involved
 are beginning to come together.
 Next time: A x False x Rage.
 Yeah, screw you!
 Sorry, Killua...
 I won't forgive you.
 Here's a chocolate robot.

 A x False x Rage
 Though the central tower's third floor
 escaped destruction, having been
 cushioned by Morel's Smoky Jail,
 it had been blown slightly to
 the left of its original position,
 barely keeping the building's appearance intact
 while maintaining a precarious balance.
 Nearby, in the middle of the
 central tower's lower portion,
 which had been reduced to rubble
 resembling an ancient gladiator arena...
 I am a foolish servant of the King,
 letting my rage consume me as I hunt my prey.
 That's how I should approach it.
 That's the impression I should give them.
 Where are you hiding, little rats?
 Come out here, so I can squash you!
 I know he'll show himself again...
 To exploit the opening just before I explode.
 It's time.
 Adding inte—
 Shut up!
 While Youpi was allowing a
 false rage to consume him,
 putting on a show of shouting
 in order to draw out Knuckle...
 No matter what happens outside,
 my goal is to pin this guy here.
 That's all I need to do!
 Approximately one hundred trillion microorganisms,
 tiny enough to pass between particles of smoke,
 maintained just enough distance
 as to go unnoticed by Morel
 as, slowly but surely, Pouf carried out
 his escape from Smoky Jail.
 Beneath the northern section of the palace
 Palace
 Border Guard Area F
 was a large area, with warehouses laid
 out in the shape of a dragonfly.
 Cultural Assets/National Treasures Area B        Weapons/Ammunition Area A
 Supreme Leader's Private Shelter Area E
 Emergency Rations/Supplies Area D    Supreme Leader's Personal Effects Area C
 Area D, located on one of the wing's tips,
 was where Bizeff had created a private zone
 with his warehouse for hiding women.
 Having learned the warehouse's
 location from Marcos,
 Ikalgo was making his way there by truck
 via a direct, five-kilometer road.
 By the time Ikalgo had reached
 the crossroads that led to Areas A and B,
 his Satellite Dragonflies had already
 arrived at the warehouse.
 The door's open...
 This is a good sign.
 Palm put Bizeff to sleep
 and headed for the palace.
 When he awoke, Bizeff forgot to lock
 the door in his rush to follow her.
 That's the likely explanation.
 Brovada's in the border guard area?
 This meant that Ikalgo
 had no choice but to face Brovada.
 Brovada doesn't trust me.
 Why? Did I make some kind of mistake?
 Stay calm...
 Stay calm and figure out what he
 knows and what he doesn't,
 in order to stay alive!
 What happened during our encounter
 that aroused his suspicion?
 Was there something unnatural
 about my imitation of Flutter?
 I suppose it would be strange for Hagya
 to order me to go underground.
 But since they didn't stop me on the spot,
 my mistake must not have been fatal.
 Rather, something aroused an inkling
 of doubt in the back of Brovada's mind.
 And Brovada's down here because he
 wants to confirm those doubts!
 Was it small enough that I can explain?
 Or was it big enough that he
 only wants final verification?
 No room for optimism.
 I should assume it was a big mistake.
 Is anyone here?
 I am a messenger from the secretary!
 Depending on the response...
 No, I have to assume
 that if he has a chance, he'll attack...
 Or he'll kill me!
 I am a messenger from the secretary!
 The secretary ordered me to come here!
 Thinker Bell!
 If you're here, you must come with me at once!
 Messengers were never sent to Bizeff's warehouse.
 This was meant to reassure
 Palm that he was an ally.
 Why didn't you respond?
 Where's everyone else?
 I d-don't know anything about
 what's happening outside...
 I'm not allowed to talk to anyone
 other than the secretary.
 She had assumed
 that this was a test of loyalty by the secretary.
 The other women thought the same thing.
 Each room had a phone exclusively
 for communication with Bizeff,
 so it was illogical for him to send
 a messenger, hence their suspicion.
 They believed that a visit from a stranger
 must be a test to see if they could
 stay calm and follow orders
 under unusual circumstances,
 so they refused to speak to Ikalgo.
 However, that worked in Ikalgo's favor.
 Is this the place?
 The women had a much higher chance
 of surviving if they stayed here.
 Ikalgo didn't have the time to worry about
 keeping them alive, much less protecting them.
 There's writing in Nen!
 The characters, formed by aura,
 could only be seen when using Gyo.
 It was less likely that Bizeff
 would find a message that wasn't
 on paper or some other device.
 ""Heading to the palace.
 If I don't make contact before the mission,
 assume I am dead.""
 Ikalgo had expected this.
 But he still felt as much anguish as
 if he had lost part of his own body.
 Palm...
 If Palm is dead or assumed to be dead,
 use your Satellite Dragonflies and
 telepathy to support the team.
 Got it.
 Pretend that you're reporting
 to your Squadron Leader,
 when you're actually reporting to Meleoron.
 So you want me to feed the enemy lies,
 to throw them off?
 Yes. It's a crucial task.
 I'm counting on you.
 That will only be possible
 if they don't know Meleoron is here,
 or that I've switched sides.
 Which means that, since he
 is already suspicious of me,
 I must eliminate Brovada!
 Yo, did you finish your mission from Hagya?
 Yeah... I did.
 Hagya, huh?
 Doesn't he get mad when we call him that?
 Okay, the fake is dead.
 Empty?
 Whatever, I'll just ask Hagya.
 The suspect is now dead!
 Once Brovada reports that to the other Ants,
 I can move around freely.
 Still, I never heard anything about
 Hagya changing his name!
 What's he called now?
 It's true that I really knew
 nothing of his new name...
 But will they believe that?
 I must think of a reason they'll accept
 if I encounter any of them.
 No, that won't work!
 Brovada opened fire without warning!
 That shows they think anyone who doesn't
 know Hagya's new name is an enemy.
 If they find me, there'll be a battle!
 I have to go back up there expecting that!
 Please enter your code number.
 The elevator isn't ascending!
 Don't tell me that he came
 down here without knowing
 about the passcode system.
 This is my chance!
 I have two options to pick from!
 Show yourself!
 It's nearly been five minutes since
 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy activated.
 Which means the Nen I've
 loaned him is nearing 7,000.
 Is that enough to guarantee that he won't
 pay off the full balance with one hit?
 I just...
 I just have to avoid a direct hit.
 The worst possible scenario
 would be that I'm hit
 by an attack that wipes out Chapter 7
 Bankruptcy, and also deals damage to me.
 If that's gonna happen,
 I'm better off buying time,
 waiting for him to go bust.
 But that means I'll have to wait
 for at least ten minutes.
 Shoot... Shoot won't last that long!
 I have to make him explode once more.
 Or else we'll run out of time!
 Before the battle ends, Shoot will die!
 You look happy, monster!
 He fell for my trap, for my false rage.
 I've been looking for you, cockroach.
 Make this damn fly that's
 following me around shut up!
 Damn Fly
 Every time it squeaks,
 I'm reminded of your annoying face!
 Okay, I'm ready to explode at any time.
 But I'll be faking it...
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Just shut up!
 Right before I explode, I pause for a moment.
 He'll try to attack during that opening.
 But if I stay calm when my rage takes over,
 I can control my growth.
 Get this thing off me right now...
 Or I'll kill you!
 I'll blow every last one of you
 to smithereens, you scum!
 When he tries to take advantage of
 the opening I give him, he'll be open.
 And I'll take advantage of that.
 That won't happen, you giant lump.
 You're gonna die on your knees right here.
 The next one...
 The next tick of the interest will be the gong.
 I'll show you who the cockroach is here.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 This will work.
 I have time to land one... No, two hits!
 I have time to punch him in the face,
 and get out of the way before the explosion!
 Take this, pig!
 This one's for Shoot!
 And the next one's also for Shoot!
 Is something wrong with me?
 I was never that close to him...
 Actually, to be honest, I didn't really like him.
 I don't even know when he
 climbed to the rank of ""friend""...
 So why am I this desperate to avenge him?
 It's not even ""vengeance,"" since he's not dead...
 Well, I guess a lot of it is that
 we've faced death together...
 Anyone who's risked their
 life with you is a friend.
 But this bastard insulted Shoot's resolve!
 He ignored someone who entered
 a fight with him expecting to die?
 Has he no sympathy as a warrior?
 Damn Ant!
 I'm getting more and more pissed off!
 I'll give him a third punch for myself!
 Wow... I'm amazing myself!
 I don't think my mind has ever thought this fast!
 And I haven't finished throwing my punch?
 Wait...
 Is this what they mean?
 Time's almost frozen.
 Everything slows down...
 right before you die?
 He stopped the explosion!
 He got me!
 He was actually keeping his cool...
 I can't stop!
 Sorry, Shoot...
 I screwed up!
 The interest won't be enough to pay for this.
 It's over...
 Shoot...
 Boss...
 Everyone...
 Everything is...
 up to you.
 Thunderbolt!
 Lightning?
 He's completely paralyzed...
 This is my chance!
 If you're not all big, I can knock you silly!
 I did it! I did it! I did it!
 I'm done! I can't do any more!
 Crap, I almost died!
 I could see the pearly gates...
 My first task is to get Shoot to a hospital.
 I hit him eight times!
 What just happened?
 I'm sure he fell for my trap.
 What happened?
 That's obvious.
 I didn't notice there was an attack
 coming from a different direction...
 Is that possible?
 That I didn't notice a bolt of lightning that massive
 until it was right over me?
 The same thing happened before.
 Before I even realized it,
 this little nuisance was on me.
 There were no signs at all.
 I saw him back at the staircase...
 Did he do it?
 Sorry, but what's about to happen is
 just me blowing off some steam.
 Next time: Strong x Or x Weak.
 Octopus or Ikalgo? Which do you go with?

 Ikan agree with that!

119,"I saw him back at the staircase...
 Did he do it?
 Sorry, but what's about to happen is
 just me blowing off some steam.
 Strong x Or x Weak
 He disappeared?
 Godspeed.
 The difference in initial action
 speed was so overwhelming
 that Youpi had no time to
 make a sound or transform.
 Killua's Godspeed placed an
 electrical burden upon his own body,
 making it possible for his body to
 perform at a level far beyond
 what should have been possible.
 Killua had divided this power
 into two different abilities:
 Speed of Lightning, which allowed
 him to control his body at will,
 Speed of Lightning
 and Whirlwind, which allowed his body
 to react automatically to his opponent.
 Whirlwind
 In a previous fight, he'd used the
 latter to stop his opponent's dart.
 A preprogrammed attack is triggered in response
 to vibrations in aura that
 indicate the opponent's hostility.
 The attack bypasses commands from his brain,
 unleashing attacks that transcend his
 own limits by relying on reflexes alone,
 allowing him to easily surpass
 his opponent's physical speed.
 What's going on here?
 All of these guys have less than
 ten percent of my raw power.
 This makes no sense...
 I can't do a thing against him.
 Whirlwind!
 Profound...
 This ""aura"" stuff is intense...
 This is getting interesting.
 Before my explosion, I never would
 have enjoyed fighting an uphill battle.
 Youpi's change in heart would lead him
 to make an unbelievable choice,
 but this would not happen until later.
 Crap!
 I used it all up!
 Hold it!
 You're not getting away!
 You're seeing this through with me...
 Until you die!
 He disappeared?
 Again.
 He vanished, as though he were
 never here to begin with.
 That's it...
 At least one of them must have the ability
 to make people appear and disappear at will.
 Huh?
 Please enter your passcode.
 Damn, I didn't get a code.
 Your passcode and name do not match.
 Please reenter your passcode.
 A second input error will result in your restraint.
 He came down here without a passcode?
 Okay... Guess I'll have to step out.
 The door has been locked.
 Please enter your passcode.
 This is my chance!
 I have two options.
 The elevator will fill with
 sleeping gas eventually.
 Once he's asleep, I have to decide.
 One, I leave Brovada in the elevator,
 Monitor Room
 and head for the surface through the cargo entrance.
 This way, when he wakes up,
 he'll still be stuck in the elevator.
 But there's a high risk that someone above
 will notice that the elevator isn't coming up.
 Two, I move Brovada somewhere
 else while he's asleep.
 There are plenty of trucks parked around.
 And the warehouse doors require a
 passcode to open from the inside.
 When he wakes up, Brovada won't
 be able to open them.
 And if I use the cargo entrance
 to return to the surface,
 the risk that I'll encounter enemies will
 be much lower than if I take the elevator.
 No! That won't work!
 I have to kill Brovada while he's asleep!
 That's the safest option!
 Then, I have to take control of Brovada's corpse,
 and use it to take out other Squadron Leaders.
 That's the least it'll take!
 I'll stick the barrel of my gun through
 the gap in his armor and open fire.
 Ikalgo had the ability to control dead bodies,
 but he had never killed anyone
 with his own hands before.
 Enter your passcode at once.
 If a passcode is not entered
 within thirty seconds,
 the restraining process will begin.
 The monitor room in the border guard area...
 There should be a monitor
 for the elevator camera,
 and a button to open the doors!
 Well, I'm outside now,
 but I had to destroy the elevator...
 Is there another exit?
 I was naïve...
 I didn't expect him to shoot the door.
 What now?
 Do I wait for him to lower his guard,
 then sneak out the cargo entrance?
 Or do I wait for him to leave?
 Either way, if he goes back to the surface...
 That's not good enough!
 I'm being naïve!
 If he returns to the surface,
 and tells the others that Flutter's dead,
 I'll be able to move around freely!
 Am I an idiot?
 If I allow an enemy to return to the surface,
 I'm putting everyone else in more danger.
 This one's tough.
 I can't let him go back up...
 If I can't stop him, I've failed my friends!
 Yes, this way!
 I'm gonna trap you.
 A little farther...
 Wait until he's a little farther from it...
 Now!
 So there was someone besides Flutter...
 Looks like you were trying to lure me in there...
 Too bad for you.
 If only one path remains, it's too good
 to be true. Anyone would be suspicious.
 Well, now I know about you.
 And I bet you're hiding in the
 monitor room to watch me, chicken!
 Damn...
 I could have completely
 trapped him in that hallway...
 But there's no way out from where he is now.
 He's still trapped.
 Sleeping gas will eventually
 fill the room, and he'll...
 Crap! He isn't trapped!
 There's a way out!
 I should get out of here...
 That's probably sleeping gas.
 I have to do something before he realizes.
 I know...
 The armored vehicles in the garage.
 With those, I could at least lock him in.
 But then I'll have no way to get
 back to the surface, either!
 Think...
 Is there anything I can use here?
 Come up with the best possible plan, fast!
 I guess I have to blow through this shutter...
 How annoying!
 I have to do this!
 Damn! All that firing, and I
 barely scorched the surface?
 Guess I'll need to think of something else...
 I know!
 You can operate the shutters
 from the monitor room,
 Monitor Room
 so I can go there to open the shutters.
 Nice idea!
 Wait,
 I have to go through the shutters
 to reach the monitor room.
 Damn, so I have to get through these
 shutters to return to the surface?
 Wait...
 There might be a way
 to escape without busting down the shutters.
 The shutter's opening?
 An armored vehicle?
 That's something a chicken would use.
 But the shutter behind it is still shut.
 The door to the monitor room is beyond that shutter.
 Which means that...
 First,
 he closed the front shutter and
 parked the vehicle there.
 Then he returned to the monitor room,
 and started raising the front shutter
 and lowering the back one,
 before racing back to the vehicle?
 Doesn't that mean he's also trapped?
 He closed off his only escape
 route, just to finish me off?
 Heh... Yeah, right.
 So there's more than one...
 The other's watching in the monitor room.
 Pisses me off!
 Watch this, you peeping tom...
 I'm gonna drag your buddy
 out of the armored vehicle
 and rip him to shreds!
 I'm the only one here.
 I have to do something...
 By myself!
 That's tough armor!
 I did it!
 Crap! He blocked the elevator!
 I could have blown a hole in the
 ceiling, and climbed up the wire!
 I've blocked his escape route.
 First hurdle cleared!
 You have guts to show yourself...
 I'm gonna riddle you with bullets!
 Smoke?
 Did he kill himself?
 Miss his chance to escape?
 Either way, there's no way to move this thing!
 There's only a few centimeters of space.
 The elevator's completely blocked!
 Hey! Your friend's gonna burn to death!
 If you act now, I'm willing to spare you!
 Open the damned shutter!
 You hear me?
 Being an octopus, I only need a few
 centimeters to squeeze through.
 Second hurdle cleared.
 Hey!
 Open the shutter!
 Now, I just have to wait for the
 sleeping gas to fill the room.
 I can hold my breath,
 but I don't want to waste time.
 Wait for the right timing!
 Third hurdle cleared.
 Be patient.
 Nice and slow.
 This is the final hurdle.
 I just have to pull the trigger, and I'm done.
 Fire! This is the best option!
 I'll be safest if I control his body
 and return to the surface!
 Which means I have to kill him...
 I'm the only one here.
 There's no one else to help me!
 I h-have to...
 kill him!
 I can't do it!
 I'm...
 I'm...
 just a coward!
 While Ikalgo was lamenting his weakness...
 Within the shifted central tower,
 as Morel faced off against Pouf's cocoon,
 he was battling doubts of his own, as well.
 Hold on.
 What if...
 Pitou! Pouf!
 Are you there?
 Hey!
 What if it isn't that he chose
 not to respond to Youpi,
 but that he wasn't able to respond?
 Within the cocoon should be
 nothing but a goopy mess.
 He shouldn't be a completely formed creature yet.
 If he's utterly defenseless
 while he changes forms,
 this is the time to attack.
 Would he really make such a literally
 fatal mistake in this situation?
 It's not possible!
 This must be a trap. It's guaranteed to be a trap.
 But the question is whether the
 trap activates when I attack,
 or if it's already been activated,
 before I've even attacked.
 Which is it?
 You have doubts because you
 are good at what you do.
 However, that is all there is to it.
 Attack? Don't attack?
 What do I do?
 Next time: Fake x And x Real.
 Hey... If not now, when?
 Not yet!
 You're a fake. You aren't Killua.

120,"No way...
 Where did he go, in that condition?!
 Shoot...
 Fake X And X Real
 You intend to fight?
 You will abandon your original plan, and
 commit yourself to a baseless assumption?
 You really believe...
 Smoky Jail, undo!
 I see you've made your decision.
 Once I stopped to think about it,
 it was pretty simple.
 You used your cocoon after I played my card.
 Since you went into hiding
 only after learning my agenda,
 I knew that was your ability,
 and that it was a trap.
 Your lack of reaction when I lifted
 my pipe to strike confirmed it.
 It made no sense that you showed
 no sign of reacting at all.
 Fifteen minutes.
 That was how long I expected you to take
 before deciding to remove the smoke barrier.
 During that time, I intended to slip
 through the smoke and move freely.
 You trapped me within that barrier
 to separate me from the King, yes?
 Meaning, as long as your
 prison of smoke was there,
 your allies would see it and
 conclude that I was still inside.
 I decided to take advantage
 of that misconception, and
 quietly dispose of your friends.
 I knew you would hesitate long enough
 to give me plenty of time to act.
 You thought I'd spend fifteen minutes
 waiting in front of an empty cocoon?
 You really underestimated me.
 No, on the contrary, it appears...
 I overestimated you!
 He instantly broke himself up into tiny particles?
 If that's how he broke through Smoky Jail,
 I wouldn't have seen a thing!
 You should have waited longer...
 Because my strategy was a last resort.
 To be honest, I was upset by the
 fact that I'd been trapped.
 Not a very good diversion strategy.
 You just contradicted yourself.
 You made it through the smoke just fine!
 At that point, that was all there was to it.
 I was under the impression that
 you were a more capable soldier...
 One who would carry out his original
 plan and be faithful to his mission.
 However, you made some wild guesses
 and removed the barrier.
 I must thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 Deep Purple!
 Run!
 I can't destroy them?
 They just break up and reform?
 He's invincible?
 Thank you! Bye-bye!
 Don't be fooled...
 He's playing mind games!
 My decision to attack the
 cocoon was the best option.
 No, the moment I second-guess myself,
 I've played into his hands.
 My next job
 is to predict his objective, and stop him...
 To join up with the rest of the Royal Guard,
 to find and eliminate my companions,
 and to reunite with the King!
 That must be it...
 His interests are consistent with mine.
 There's no problem!
 I'll take this!
 He's fast!
 I'll find somewhere safe to throw this away!
 He got me...
 I can't use any other abilities.
 If Deep Purple is undone,
 I'll be completely helpless!
 I'll have to find a way to get by,
 using Deep Purple alone.
 Yo, are you
 the esper?
 What'd you do with Shoot, huh?
 What?
 Eighty-nine Deep Purple puppets...
 The maximum number I could
 produce in my current state.
 I'll use them to support Knuckle as best I can.
 I see what you're doing...
 I'll let you hit me once.
 But in return...
 I'll take your life!
 Okay, no one's here.
 This is our chance to escape.
 Let's go.
 Man, they said we'd be safe here.
 I can't get in touch with Leol-sama.
 Since my stomach shrunk, that probably
 means Cheetu-sama's dead...
 And I haven't heard anything from
 Flutter, so I guess that's it.
 I'll leave to become a Queen!
 I'll make you my second-in-command.
 How's that?
 Help...
 Please...
 get me out of here...
 Help!
 Oh, Secretary Bizeff...
 You're in trouble.
 I can't move my legs...
 Whatever, let's go.
 This looks dangerous.
 What? Wait... Please!
 I'm going to die!
 No can do... I can't move all that.
 Then, could you call for help?
 Like, seriously...
 I'm in a hurry to get out of this place!
 The boss is missing, our link
 with the King is gone,
 and the palace is a mess.
 I have no reason to stay here!
 I'll give you whatever reward you want!
 There are mountains of treasure underground!
 If you help me, I'll give you anything you want.
 So please pull me out!
 Where underground?
 There's an area for the Supreme
 Leader beyond the shelter.
 I've been managing the treasure inside.
 I'm the only one with access...
 You'll give me anything I want?
 You'd better keep your promise.
 Or I'll kill you!
 Treasure! Treasure!
 Treasure, treasure, treasure!
 It's over...
 This nation is finished.
 That was clearly proven
 when the air assault began before
 I was able to make any arrangements.
 They're probably calling the Ants biological
 weapons, to use them as an excuse...
 If I'm captured by the Federation,
 they'll force me to confess for a cover
 story and throw me in prison for life,
 or they'll execute me, so I can't talk.
 I won't let them capture me...
 I'm going to escape!
 The smoke-user is now out of action.
 Now, I'll go back to the palace,
 evaluate the current situation,
 and return to the King.
 Though I'm sure that even if I stay with him,
 the King will only find me a nuisance.
 Beelzebub!
 Lord of the Flies
 Beelzebub
 Go forth, my clones...
 Identify the location and status of
 every person inside the palace!
 Pouf's Beelzebub was an ability that allowed him
 to disassemble into copies of himself
 as small as one billionth his size.
 He was able to control the size
 and number of copies produced,
 and the smaller the copies,
 the more he could produce.
 However, his main body,
 which served as a control center,
 could only be reduced to a bee's size.
 Smoke-man, if you hadn't removed the barrier,
 my main body could not have escaped.
 My combat capacity would
 have been reduced by half.
 I'm sure a puppet master such as yourself
 must know the incomparable difference in
 strength between a clone and your own body.
 Now that my main body is free,
 I have no weaknesses.
 You have lost.
 You should have been more careful.
 If you had, then when you realized
 the cocoon was empty,
 you should have wondered
 whether what had been inside it
 had actually escaped the barrier.
 And if I had spoken to you
 from outside the barrier,
 you should have wondered whether
 that was my real self.
 The plan I executed was an act of desperation.
 I could attempt to confuse your allies,
 but my clones are mere husks.
 Assuming that your allies were as strong as you,
 even if it took a few casualties,
 they would have noticed
 that my clones were fakes!
 Had you comprehended the truth,
 and realized that my main body
 remained within the barrier,
 you would have understood my
 ability, and searched for me.
 If you had done so,
 I would have had no way to
 fight you in my reduced state...
 In other words, if you had maintained
 the barrier as per your original goal,
 your allies may have suffered a bit,
 but you would have been able to defeat me.
 And I was ten-percent resolved
 to accept that fate.
 Your emotions were perfectly
 aligned to accomplish that.
 I suppose the explosion
 must have thrown you off.
 A pity...
 However, I am now free.
 Next, I will evaluate the situation in the palace!
 From the start of the mission,
 Morel's condition was less than optimal.
 His exhaustion and impatience, combined
 with the extreme tension of the situation,
 clearly led him to the hasty decision
 to engage Pouf in a battle of nerves.
 However, he arrived at the
 perfect time to support Knuckle,
 keeping him from engaging Youpi alone.
 As a result, it could be said that
 he made the correct decision
 to remove Smoky Jail at that time.
 And it was more than simply
 a product of coincidence.
 It would be valid to say Morel's wealth of
 experience played a role in saving him.
 Upon entering the palace,
 Morel had weighed the strength of the enemies
 against that of his allies.
 Subconsciously, he knew that they
 had underestimated the enemy.
 When he realized the length of time his allies
 could hold out was shorter than anticipated,
 he was led to attack the cocoon in order
 to avoid struggling with the pros and cons
 of removing Smoky Jail to go help them.
 Morel's cunning, derived from his knowledge
 of the battlefield, saved his comrades.
 The real one's hidden among the fakes,
 trying to attack me, right?
 This time, I'll land a counter on you!
 Five were taken out...
 I have eighty-four left!
 The smoke ones are fake.
 They feel completely different.
 When the real one lands a hit, I'll know.
 That's when you'll be finished!
 Seventy-five left!
 Seventy-two...
 Seventy...
 Pitou and the woman are on the
 west tower's second floor.
 Pitou appears to be healing the woman.
 A boy, who appears to be an
 enemy, is sitting nearby.
 Three near the entrance to
 the underground shelter...
 Hina, a Soldier Ant, and Bizeff!
 They may be heading underground.
 Welfin is behind them.
 He appears to be following them.
 The woman was injured by the dragon spears.
 But why doesn't the enemy attack Pitou?
 Could he be acquainted with the woman?
 One in the soldiers' lounge, in the east tower...
 The human captured a few days ago.
 It will be born soon.
 Oh, this area's crazy...
 There are lots of enemies.
 One, two, three...
 But Youpi is taking them out quickly.
 Youpi and approximately fifty enemies
 are in the north area of the palace!
 It's the smoke-guy and a bunch of thugs.
 Also, a weird fatso with a spike on its head!
 Unable to determine if it is friend or foe.
 Is the spike-head Youpi's true power?
 Only one of the thugs is real,
 while the rest are made of smoke.
 The number of puppets is not increasing
 because he needs the pipe to make more.
 It'll take Youpi less than a minute
 to find the real one.
 The King is gone! Where is he?
 Everyone, return!
 What's wrong?
 You're running out of clones.
 My attacks are too fast for you to get close.
 Should I leave an opening for
 him to come in and attack?
 Carefully...
 Act natural.
 Here you go...
 Come on!
 He's a fake?
 Wait...
 You finally figured it out, idiot?
 There never was a real one.
 I'll kill you!
 There is a real one, right here!
 No kidding!
 An aura explosion?
 From Youpi?
 Did he really need to use such an ability?
 I'm worried...
 But locating the King is my first priority!
 You saved me, boss!
 If you hadn't set that restriction,
 I would have snapped and rushed him!
 Listen to me...
 I will create only angry clones of you
 when you've lost control of your temper.
 If that happens, you are to join the clones,
 and give careful thought to what must be done.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 I got it.
 After cooling down and thinking about it,
 I realized that he wouldn't have taken Shoot.
 But if Shoot couldn't move on his own,
 who would have moved him?
 Damn... Stop thinking about it!
 I need to focus on the opponent before me!
 Where...
 am I?
 That's...
 Uh-oh!
 Hurry up!
 Go in before the entrance is blocked!
 Damn, Bizeff is my prey!
 If I knew what powers they had,
 I could make a move.
 Don't come any closer...

 Why?
 Had you remained silent,
 I could have killed him.
 Why are you so needlessly frightened?
 He noticed you.
 If you'd approached him with the intent to kill,
 he would have immediately attacked Komugi.
 That was a risk I didn't want to take.
 Your words baffle me.
 Isn't he sitting there because
 he wants to help that girl?
 You almost make it sound like
 he means to harm her.
 Why?
 It's none of your business.
 Shut up.
 Once I'm charged up, I'm going back to Gon.
 You go find Knuckle.
 Pouf is outside the barrier,
 so it's very likely the big guy was taken out.
 Review the situation,
 then you and Knuckle decide what
 to do, and whether to retreat.
 Wh-What about you guys?
 Once Gon is in that state, he won't budge.
 At worst, he'll trade his life for Pitou's.
 I'm kidding!
 It'll be fine.

 I have it under control.
 Really?
 Then why did you
 look so sad back there?
 You're sure, then?
 You can't talk... And you don't want to, anyway.
 Then I can't ask, and I don't want to!
 It's none of your business.
 Shut up.
 Shut up?
 Downwind, huh?
 Am I interrupting something?
 Pitou, I'll let you handle this, then.
 Don't move.
 Stay right there.
 You can use your wing scales to control others, right?
 Don't take a single step.
 Pouf, please!
 Are you insane?
 You want me to stand here and do nothing?
 For that woman's sake?
 For the King's sake!
 Do as he says...
 What happened?
 Your expression has changed...
 What happened while I was trapped?
 I promise that I shall not move from this spot.
 In return, I want you to tell me
 everything that has happened thus far.
 If I ask where the King is, he'll
 get suspicious and silence us.
 Drop me hints while you explain what's happened.
 Be careful to make it sound quite natural.
 If you fail, we will see bloodshed.
 That's all there is to it.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 I've got it...
 I could feel myself controlling the explosion.
 If I try it once more, I'll have it mastered.
 I need rage...
 I must build up my rage before
 I forget how it felt!
 That's the second time you've
 made a fool out of me!
 Scum! Trash!
 Piece of crap!
 Stay calm, and let rage consume me...
 Create and destroy at the same time.
 Manifested through this body!
 Youpi had yet to notice
 why two conflicting emotions
 could exist simultaneously...
 Or what his current predicament was.
 Rage...
 Rage is not intended to be scattered.
 It's meant to be focused on a target!
 I Will Destroy You!!!
 I will destroy you!
 Okay! Okay!
 It's a fake, okay!
 Keep it up...
 Make me madder!
 Come on!
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 APR's interest is calculated
 assuming that aura consumption will
 continue to rise at the current rate.
 Even if Youpi were to reduce his
 aura usage to a bare minimum,
 in another three minutes and fifty seconds,
 he would reach the point at which
 he would be unable to use Nen.
 Ten left.
 My back's against the wall...
 Looks like he's saving me for last.
 In that case, I'll keep fighting as long as I can!
 Morel had deployed all of his puppets
 close enough for Youpi to see
 so that he'd be able to monitor Youpi's movements,
 but also because he no longer had the
 strength to move his puppets around.
 If he lost his focus, the puppets would
 return to smoke and dissipate.
 It shouldn't be much longer...
 He has to run out of Nen at some point.
 But...
 But damn...
 My body and soul...
 refuse to move.
 At this point, Morel could not
 even will himself to stand.
 He had literally reached his limit
 even before Youpi went bankrupt.
 Zero left...
 I have something to say to you.
 Now that Youpi had learned
 how to store his rage elsewhere,
 his head was much clearer.
 You look like a little fly that's about to die.
 And yet...
 That's what makes you guys amazing.
 During the battle, Youpi had
 evolved at an alarming rate,
 increasing the gap between
 the Hunters and himself.
 Yet he had nothing but praise for the defeated.
 Given Morel's initial impression of Youpi,
 this must have been the last thing he
 expected Youpi to say in this situation.
 But Morel could honestly accept
 that this was Youpi's true nature.
 I'm not sure how to say this...
 But because you've impressed me,
 I have to be sure to kill you.
 It's only proper, I guess?
 This is game over.
 Well, I'll end this with one blow.
 Don't move.
 I don't think I even mind letting him
 kill me now.
 Bye.
 He disappeared?
 There's blood...
 What's going on?
 It wasn't teleportation?
 The moment I was about to cut through him,
 he disappeared.
 I thought that one of them had the
 ability to use teleportation...
 But when he disappeared,
 I didn't see anyone else.
 And I struck before he disappeared, so if
 he teleported, I shouldn't have drawn blood.
 But I was able to cut him.
 Yet I can no longer see him.
 Does that mean he only turned invisible?
 An ability to become transparent?
 If he had that ability,
 he would have used it sooner.
 Which means one of the others
 must be able to make himself
 and the rest invisible.
 And right before I connected, he tried
 to save the guy with the sunglasses.
 But I left a deep wound.
 Here he comes!
 The blood...
 Youpi can follow the blood!
 We may be invisible, but the
 blood is leaving a trail.
 If he swings that blade again,
 I'll have to get away by myself.
 I'm running out of breath...
 Damn it!
 Knuckle?!
 Why did you reveal yourself?
 Right now, your job is to stay
 hidden as long as possible!
 I'm done running and hiding.
 I'll face you.
 So...
 Let them escape.
 Knuckle chose to use words instead of his fists
 because Youpi's words had
 struck a chord with him.
 You're crazy.
 You can't even call that a trade-off.
 My answer
 is no.
 However...
 If you get rid of this thing,
 my answer might change.
 I'm sure this has to do with why you've
 been constantly on the run.
 Removing it will make the
 exchange more even.
 No... Don't do it!
 Knuckle, you'd better not be stupid!
 Morel's desperate cry did not reach
 Knuckle due to God's Accomplice.
 However, it did return Meleoron to his senses.
 Leave me here...
 You can't!
 You can't do that, Knuckle!
 Don't worry about me...
 Will you waste everything we've done?
 Everything that Morel, and Shoot...
 and you...
 have done by risking your lives!
 If Knuckle didn't act, the two of
 them could still fight together.
 To do that, Meleoron had to stay hidden.
 With that in mind, the decision that
 Meleoron made after leaving Morel...
 Knuckle!
 Knuckle!
 ...ended up backfiring.
 Impossible...
 We no longer have a way...
 to defeat Youpi...
 Why...
 The sight of a bloody Morel had reminded
 Knuckle of Shoot, and broken him.
 Okay... I took away APR!
 Now the terms are even.
 Leave the boss alone!
 Fight me!
 Kill me!
 No way.
 Hold on!
 Where are you going?!
 To the King, obviously.
 Do you want to come with me?
 I doubt you could handle it.
 His ability isn't teleportation, is it?
 Then you'll have to carry the
 guy in sunglasses to a doctor,
 or you struck this deal for nothing.
 If protecting the King was his first priority,
 he should have killed all three on the spot.
 It's no big deal...
 You weaklings can attack me all you
 want, but I'll still shake you off.
 The fact that he was aware of this,
 but didn't carry it out,
 irritated Youpi on a level that didn't
 compare to his previous rage.
 Come for me whenever you want.
 I'll fight you as equals.
 I don't need to kill you right now...
 And that's all there is to it!
 Damn, I picked up Pouf's habit.
 During this battle, Youpi had learned
 how profound Nen really was.
 That also altered what little
 sense of self he'd had before.
 Having learned to quarantine
 his rage and stay calm,
 Youpi had lost his ability to
 see things in simple terms.
 They're responsible for the rage I've built up,
 so why don't I feel like using it on them?
 What, or who, am I supposed
 to unleash this rage upon?
 Was this a sign of maturation?
 Youpi wasn't sure.
 However, as for Knuckle...
 I completely lost...
 Knuckle!
 We gotta help the big guy!
 Come on, boss.
 I told you to leave me here...
 Go!
 The two of you...
 can still fight.
 Do what you can.
 He said to go whenever you want.
 So go now!
 I can't.
 I can no longer think of him...
 as a target to destroy.
 Wait...
 He acknowledged our efforts.
 He wasn't a bad guy.
 In that case, I no longer have...
 any reason to defeat him.
 The King...
 Knov-san!
 The soldiers are not important.
 If the King waves his baton, the soldiers
 will become demons if necessary.
 I'll take care of Morel...
 Shoot is also okay.
 Are you guys also coming?
 Wait, let me sock this baby hard.
 I received a message from
 the chairman's messenger.
 As planned, he was able to take the
 King to the appointed location.
 If they leave now, the Royal
 Guard won't make it in time.
 Their job is done, and so is ours.
 Where's Palm?
 We don't know yet.
 Okay...
 What will you do?
 I don't know if I'll be back again.
 You can see how bad I look...
 Are you going or staying?
 We're staying.
 We still have a job to do.
 I see.
 You're strong...
 Let's go.
 To look for Palm?
 No, we can do that later.
 There's something else we have to do.
 Youpi isn't the only Royal Guard!

 Huh? Why now?
 Just do it!

 Pose x And x Name
 This is an area used for testing weapons of war.
 We won't need to restrain ourselves.
 Why do you fight?
 You have no chance of defeating me.
 Why rush to your death?
 You presume to know I cannot win?
 You know nothing about me.
 If you judge me by my appearance,
 you'll get burned.
 You have it backwards.
 You don't seem like some ordinary man
 who can't read the state of the battle.
 I was born to rule this world.
 Originally, you humans were as
 no more than livestock to me.
 But I have changed my mind.
 I learned that there are a few
 humans worth keeping alive.
 Like that woman.
 I sense that you are worthy, as well.
 If you back down now,
 I am willing to spare your life.
 You'll only spare my life, yes?
 Given my position,
 I can't accept that offer.
 Meanwhile...
 In exchange for his agreement to stay still,
 Pouf was pressing Pitou to explain
 just what had happened.
 Pitou complied with Pouf's request, telling
 him what happened after the attack.
 In other words, everything since
 they'd been separated.
 Pitou made it a point to include
 details that Gon did not know,
 to ensure that Gon's attention would
 be focused on the explanation.
 Pitou deliberately did not mention
 how the King had held Komugi
 because Pitou did not know how to
 describe the events accurately.
 There was no significant change in Gon.
 However...
 Pitou knew the plan had succeeded
 when Gon's eyes wavered briefly.
 The King...
 left with the enemy of his own
 volition, by that doorway.
 There is no need for us to go.
 I see.
 He went south.
 I understand.
 A fine play, Pitou.
 Then we should await the King's return here.
 To maintain only my outward appearance,
 I only need one-seventh of my flies.
 The other six-sevenths
 will go to the King!
 You fight with the resolve to lose?
 I do not understand.
 You fight for the human race?
 If so, then know that my actions
 are, in fact, for their benefit.
 For example, in human society,
 lands are divided by national borders,
 much like territorial marking.
 On the right side of the border,
 children may starve to death.
 While on the left, scum who do nothing
 have everything they need.
 Absolute madness.
 I shall crush that madness...
 And create a world so fair,
 the very concept of inequality will be forgotten!
 I concede that
 I will initially use power and terror
 to accomplish my objective.
 But I will only do so to the extent
 necessary to maintain order.
 I have learned what power
 is meant to be used for.
 To protect the weak,
 who deserve to live.
 Power is not meant to be used
 to torment the defeated!
 This could be a problem...
 I shall not fight you.
 I agreed to leave the palace
 so we could have a free, open discussion.
 He's wavering...
 Come closer.
 Wavering between Ant and human.
 And he hasn't realized
 that those two sides are incompatible.
 And neither one
 is dominant yet.
 But regardless of which side he falls to,
 the outcome won't change.
 We're counting on you.
 You have a single mission.
 The immediate extermination
 of these dangerous creatures.
 There have already been many casualties.
 We will use any means necessary.
 Will that be acceptable?
 Naturally, we have no intention of
 telling the experts how to proceed.
 We simply desire
 those dangerous creatures
 eradicated as swiftly as possible.
 Understood.
 So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
 leaving the Hunters Association
 to take the blame.
 I must make this fast...
 Before my heart is swayed.
 King...
 We are both in difficult positions.
 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva
 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva!
 First Hand
 First Hand!
 That's...
 I can't sense anyone else fighting.
 Does that mean I'm the only one left?
 Youpi!
 Pouf!
 You've changed a lot since I last saw you.
 I could say the same to you.
 I had to escape without alerting the enemy.
 And if I move all my dispersed particles
 at once, it's too conspicuous.
 So I must go slowly.
 I'm sure you're feeling impatient,
 but please spare me a moment.
 I need to tell you what's happening.
 Well, I suppose you have your own concerns...
 You've grown up.
 And there you have it.
 I have no conclusive proof
 that the change in Pitou will
 actually benefit the King...
 Through his own experiences,
 Youpi could understand Pitou's behavior.
 Youpi...
 What do you think we should do?
 This was a test.
 Which made it very clear to Youpi
 that Pouf was fearful of the subtle changes
 Pitou and Youpi had undergone.
 A foolish question.
 We must go
 to the King at once!
 And that's all there is to it... Right?
 His response was entirely sincere.
 Indeed.
 He was concerned only with
 leaving as soon as possible.
 Because Youpi was feeling the same fear.
 I'm sure that was a direct hit...
 He's tough!
 A good attack.
 I could not anticipate it.
 Are you satisfied now?
 He still wants me to sit with him?
 I shall not repeat myself.
 Third Hand
 Third Hand!
 I can no longer back down!
 Are you really so eager to die?
 From the King's perspective,
 the wrath that was unleashed
 was no stronger than that
 of a child throwing a fit.
 Yet it was violent enough to induce
 Netero to more than double the distance
 between the King and him.
 It was an insult likened to laughing off
 Netero's declaration that
 he would not back down.
 Come on...
 You will only influence me by using words.
 Damned newborn brat.
 If it were that simple,
 I wouldn't have to do this!
 Wait...
 By using...
 words?
 King...
 Would you like to know your name?
 How would you know my name?
 My subordinates were present at the

 I will tell you your name.

 and the King has begun.

 Centipede x And x Memory
 As the King and Netero prepared
 for their final battle...
 Beneath the palace, Ikalgo was still sobbing,
 having failed to finish off
 the unconscious Brovada.
 Fire! This is the best option!
 There's no one else to help me!
 I h-have to...
 kill him!
 This is no time to be crying...
 I have to find Palm!
 Huh?
 The door to the warehouse area is open.
 So is the door leading to the garage!
 Why?
 Don't move!
 If you move, I'll attack.
 Welfin...
 I have a lot of things to ask you.
 If you seem to be trying anything funny,
 I'll kill you!
 What he wants to ask me
 is obvious!
 The number of my allies,
 their roles,
 and their abilities.
 And he intends to use any means
 necessary to get the answers.
 People could die if I leak information.
 If he's a Manipulator,
 he can obtain the information against my will.
 Huh?
 D-Don't move!
 I really will kill you!
 Go ahead... Kill me.
 That's what I want!
 Stop!
 If the alternative is betraying my buddies,
 I'll take you with me!
 Ouch!
 Bastard! Now you've done it!
 Damn it!
 I'll kill you!
 Missile Man!
 I'm... not dead...
 I didn't sustain any damage.
 What was that attack?
 Damn, that hurts...
 You little punk...
 Damn...
 That bastard... How did a wimp like
 that figure out my weakness?
 Missile Man requires questions and answers to work.
 If an enemy attacks before I can ask
 a question, it's null and void!
 The wound isn't deep...
 I'll take my time beating him to a pulp.
 Huh?
 He planted something inside me?
 Those were created by my Nen.
 They're black centipedes.
 Black Centipede
 They grow by feeding on your resistance.
 If you disobey my orders or try to hurt me,
 you'll suffer excruciating pain,
 then they'll tear your body apart and you'll die!
 Wh-What are you doing, fool?
 Weren't you listening to me?
 If you try to do that...
 That's fine with me.
 If my life is all it takes, I'll give it!
 S-Stop!
 No, wait...
 If he wanted to kill me, that's the
 ultimate form of resistance.
 Now, it'll take no time for the black centipedes
 to grow large enough to kill him instantly!
 Don't worry.
 I'm not interested in killing you...
 I just need to make sure that you can't leave.
 I still...
 have plenty of bullets.
 Bastard! Don't mess with me!
 I'll kill you!
 You're dead! I'll kill you!
 It's so easy.
 When I'm prepared to offer my own life,
 it's so easy to pull the trigger.
 I g-get it...
 I get it, already.
 I won't go anywhere!
 I surrender.
 Please... Don't fire!
 The pain is going away.
 The creatures inside me are suffering?
 I lose, damn it...
 I can't move anymore.
 Is it because Welfin admitted defeat?
 Man, I knew it...
 I had a feeling this would happen eventually.
 But still...
 I didn't think I was this weak!
 I didn't think it'd be so scary
 to face someone who fights
 with no regard for their own life!
 Hey.
 What?
 The pain has stopped, but can
 you get rid of these bugs?
 Stop complaining...
 I'm in too much pain to think about that now!
 Hurry up.
 Give me a minute!
 I don't have a way to deactivate Missile Man.
 But if I tell the truth, I'm in real trouble...
 Damn, how do I get out of this?
 I need to buy time...
 Until I can come up with a good idea.
 The pain is making me...
 feel faint...
 Wait! Okay!
 I was lying! I won't do it again!
 Then get rid of these.
 Yeah, uh...
 So, the thing is...
 Forget it. I see how it is.
 Wait! Hold on!
 I can't remove them!
 Not once they've been activated!
 That's why I didn't want to say anything.
 It's the truth! Believe me!
 I'm not trying to trick you!
 The insects are in pain again.
 Maybe because Welfin is telling the truth?
 Can you really blame me?
 I only use this attack when I want to kill someone.
 I never cared what happened after that.
 I never gave any thought to
 what happened to my enemy.
 Nen abilities are really something.
 My abilities reflect my own personality.
 My personality? His true intentions?
 Welfin...
 What do I ask him?
 What do I want to know?
 I once knew someone just like him.
 Do you have any memories from
 when you were human?
 Wh-Why are you asking about that?
 I can't remember...
 You're lying.
 Wh-What?
 Stop! Hold on!
 Calm down!
 If you don't tell me the truth, I'll shoot you.
 When I woke up,
 my first thought was...
 Damn...
 I can still remember it.
 I'm sure those monster bugs killed me in NGL.
 I was fed to the Queen,
 and reborn as something new...
 But I still...
 I still remember the one thing
 I most wanted to forget.
 The sight of my father strangling me,
 and the woman watching behind him.
 At first, I only had flashbacks of it.
 Over time, I remembered the
 entire sequence of events.
 I was saved by...
 my little brother, who was unrelated by blood.
 I remember now!
 He looked just like Gyro!
 Gyro?
 You know. The king!
 We used to brag about whose
 life was more miserable.
 He was the only one I could
 turn to when I needed
 to laugh away my tears...
 We were both empty.
 So we had nothing to hide.
 I wonder what he's doing now...
 I want to see him one more time...
 Yes, I just want to see Gyro.
 I'm tired of dealing with Ants and humans,
 with money and nations...
 Go.
 The bugs are gone.
 You still have something to do.
 Why did you open the doors?
 Oh, I was letting those weaklings
 reach the treasure in the back.
 They can't put up much of a fight.
 I was watching you and Bro on the monitor.
 And I told them to pass while
 you were on the way back.
 A coward!
 It was that simple.
 Once I saw that you couldn't finish Bro,
 I thought you'd be an easy target.
 I couldn't have been more wrong.
 Go on.
 I'm too tired to move...
 I have one last question.
 Did you see a woman in the palace?
 A woman?
 Not sure if it's the one you're talking about,
 but the Royal Guard captured a human,
 and put her in a cocoon.
 Where is she?
 Take the elevator up, then turn left.
 It's the room at the end of the hall.
 They called it #1.
 Thank you!
 What's so funny?
 Telling the truth
 feels really good...
 Welfin had spent his life unable
 to trust himself or others.
 Telling Ikalgo the location of
 the one he searched for
 was the first time he'd opened
 up and spoken honestly.
 Next time: Breakdown x And x Awakening.

124,"Approximately thirty minutes after
 the Hunters entered the palace...
 As the fierce battle unfolded inside the palace,
 an immense number of citizens
 hypnotized by Pouf's wing scales
 still waited outside for the selection process
 that would turn them into soldier ants.
 Meanwhile, a creature in the form that
 they would soon become began to stir.
 Breakdown x And x Awakening
 Okay, all charged up.
 Someone's watching me.
 And...
 It's probably someone I know.
 No one's there?
 While her appearance hadn't totally changed,
 Palm was clearly no longer the same person.
 And that greatly disturbed Killua.
 She was captured
 by the Royal Guard...
 And she's been transformed!
 If Gon sees what's happened to Palm,
 he won't be able to take it...
 There's no room left in his heart.
 If the transformation has
 reached as far as Palm's heart...
 I can see Gon completely breaking down!
 I must learn the answer.
 We still have a chance.
 Palm approached me herself!
 Palm?
 Palm must have sensed me
 before I noticed her watching me...
 Using that power she told us about before.
 Once I used my power, it was quite simple.
 I thought she could use some kind
 of divination to locate people.
 But it's probably closer to clairvoyance.
 From her position, Palm shouldn't
 have been able to see me...
 The only conclusion is that she was
 watching me by some other means.
 And if Palm were an enemy,
 she would have backed off...
 Clairvoyance is most effective from a distance.
 And if she's an enemy, she shouldn't
 remember me anymore.
 Since she approached me,
 she must remember me...
 Remember us!
 Killua, yes?
 I knew it...
 She has her memories!
 Where's Gon?
 Once he's seen what I've
 become, will Gon hate me?
 Gon doesn't judge people by appearances.
 And you're assuming that he
 doesn't already hate you.
 You're always so spiteful...
 Well, it doesn't matter.
 I have nothing to gain from your pity.
 Where's Gon?
 Gon's with Pitou.
 He's—
 Why can she see me,
 but she can't see Gon?
 What's wrong?
 Was it chance that you happened to find me?
 Huh? What are you talking about?
 You're the one who turned the corner.
 Wrong! I sensed you watching me.
 That's why I came this way!
 You noticed me first.
 Why are you lying?
 Troublesome brat...
 Where's Gon?
 Answer my question first.
 Did I notice Palm watching me
 only when she physically saw me?
 Does that mean Palm actually
 saw me once, then immediately left?
 Then she used clairvoyance
 to watch me follow her,
 and turned around so it'd look
 like she was approaching me?
 For the last time...
 Where's Gon?
 I won't tell you.
 You're an enemy, aren't you?
 I made a mistake...
 I used my power incorrectly.
 When I was brimming with rage,
 I should have let my emotions take over!
 Black Widow
 Dark Demon Goddess
 Sh-She's dangerous!
 Better to let everything out than hold it in.
 That includes my desire to kill you!
 Well? What now?
 Will you die without a word?
 Will you die after speaking?
 Or will you just die?
 Palm's ability to arm herself by covering
 her body with her hair, Black Widow,
 varied in appearance according
 to her emotional state.
 But defense was its primary function.
 What made Black Widow frightening
 was the fact that she could rely on
 her hair armor for protection,
 allowing her to devote all
 her energy to her attacks.
 P-Palm-san! Turn off your Hatsu!
 Palm is an Enhancer.
 When everything clicks, it's possible
 to become this much stronger?
 I completely blocked the attack,
 but I still took damage.
 If the fight drags on, I'll be at a total disadvantage.
 But I can't run away.
 Gon's mind is already at its limit!
 He's barely holding himself together,
 while he waits for Pitou.
 I can't let them meet.
 Even if Palm's heart is still there...
 It'll have a negative effect now!
 Palm!
 Why are you looking for Gon?
 Depending on why, I might be
 willing to tell you where he is.
 Huh? Why are you asking now?
 There's no reason...
 I just want to see him.
 He's probably nearby.
 I'll find him myself.
 Once I've killed you!
 Sorry!
 I panicked and called you an enemy...
 But even if you look different,
 you're still Palm, right?
 Gon is suffering.
 Someone he deeply respects
 was completely transformed.
 That person had his soul taken away.
 Right now, Gon is facing off
 against the one responsible!
 If you appear before Gon
 looking as you do now...
 Gon will...
 totally snap.
 So you have to
 call him by his name first.
 You must say, ""Gon.""
 That's the condition.
 Tell him you're okay.
 Before we entered the palace,
 Gon was really worried about you.
 Give him some peace of mind...
 He was just buying time.
 He had no intention of letting them meet.
 That was the idea...
 Help...
 make him feel a little better, if you can...
 Only you can do that now!
 No one else...
 can do it.
 I can't...
 do anything!
 Once he'd said those words,
 the dam within him burst.
 He's completely defenseless.
 Change in plans...
 Kill him now, #1!
 When Palm had infiltrated the palace,
 arriving at the exit Knov had
 placed near the stairway,
 Pitou's En returned.
 Surrounded by aura so evil that she felt
 as though she'd be crushed to dust,
 she reached the same conclusion Knov had.
 As she watched Pouf slowly and silently
 descend the stairs, she made her decision.
 She plotted to take her own life,
 so she would look like a despairing girl
 who could not bear Bizeff violating her.
 However, Pitou prevented that from happening.
 As one cannot help but shiver in the cold,
 no one could blame Palm for reflexively using aura
 to protect herself from Pitou's evil aura
 at the moment she was exposed to it.
 The Royal Guard was interested in her aura,
 and after receiving permission from the fasting King,
 Pitou and Pouf made her experimental soldier #1.
 Precedent had demonstrated those who remembered
 their pasts had stronger mental fortitude.
 This was most noticeable in Ants who
 had learned how to use Nen.
 Memories of the past tended to both assist
 and deter the growth of soldiers.
 Deterrence generally happened
 when memories led to emotional reactions.
 Thus, the two Royal Guards concluded
 that they should use Pitou's Dr. Blythe
 to destroy the connection between
 Palm's memories and her emotions.
 The experiments that produced Cheetu
 and Leol confirmed that those
 who retained more of their memories
 emerged from their cocoons sooner.
 To quickly and quietly conquer humanity,
 leaving soldiers with their memories, while
 keeping control of them, would be best.
 Palm was the perfect test subject.
 The success of her experiment would
 signify the end of the human race.
 Now go, #1...
 Beat the kid before you to death!
 Shut up.
 I am
 Palm Siberia.
 I'm not #1!
 I will never become a pawn to you Ants...
 Even if it costs my life!
 Killua...
 I have you to thank.
 There was a wall inside my head.
 My emotions were separated from my body.
 I couldn't do anything about it.
 I've been like this since I woke up.
 You removed the barrier.
 Don't say that there's nothing you can do.
 If I can do anything to help Gon, I'll be happy to.
 But you must not forget...
 You are the one Gon needs most.
 What is it?
 Failure.
 That's all there is to it.
 Slow and steady it is.
 Soldiers do not need memories or emotions...
 Which also means I no longer need Pitou's power.
 I can create soldiers on my own!
 That will make it easier
 to build a new kingdom
 for the King and me.

 Killua's voiced feelings toward Gon
 miraculously returned Palm to her old self.
 Meanwhile, on the west tower's second floor,
 Knuckle had ignored Meleoron's repeated warnings,
 appearing before those in the room
 in order to challenge Pouf.
 Pouf...
 Step outside.
 Very well.
 I will face you.
 But first, I have something to say.
 That which stands before you is only a clone.
 My true body is already on its way to the King.
 Having escaped the cage of smoke,
 Pouf had confirmed that Knuckle
 and Morel had made contact.
 He decided to assume
 that his enemies knew of
 his ability to create clones,
 and to act accordingly.
 That was the correct call.
 The boss told me that you could make clones.
 You're telling the truth.
 Knuckle said this aloud for Gon's sake.
 By telling the truth first, Pouf attempted
 to gain the mental advantage.
 His plan was a success.
 But why are you telling me this?
 Pouf's concern was Youpi.
 Since Knuckle was here,
 that meant that Youpi had spared his life
 and had not told Pouf this.
 Depending on his reason...
 Answer me!
 To satisfy him.
 Pouf needed to leave the room peacefully
 so that he could persuade Knuckle
 to tell him the motive behind the
 transformation he'd sensed in Youpi.
 I told you in order to satisfy him.
 He has demanded that I not leave this room.
 If we are to engage in a duel,
 I will need him to withdraw his
 demand, so that I may leave.
 I am but a clone...
 I cannot use my wing scales.
 However, I am still willing to fight you.
 What I seek is a discussion.
 That is why I revealed the truth.
 Pouf knew that when dealing with someone who
 would call him from behind to challenge him,
 appearing to be telling the truth
 would be more effective.
 You're lying...
 You were going to kill me from behind.
 You even admitted it.
 Knuckle, don't let him fool you!
 First, you claim to be a clone.
 Are you able to prove that?
 He's right.
 This boy is proving troublesome.
 I dare say that, of our enemies,
 he possesses the strongest will.
 Perhaps I should be pleased
 that he is trapped here with Pitou.
 Because his strong will keeps him in here.
 Were I to prove myself a clone, I would
 be placing myself at a disadvantage.
 So I can say nothing.
 You must use your own judgment.
 And...
 I shall allow you
 to decide what happens next.
 Pouf, you can't mean to...
 Stop...
 I'll wait in front of the entrance for ten minutes.
 Whether you come or not is your choice!
 Please wait...
 I'm still here!
 I apologize for Pouf's behavior!
 I'm the only one you need, right?
 Ten minutes.
 You have ten fewer minutes to heal her.
 Pitou was trembling.
 It was disturbing enough that
 Pouf had been willing to leave,
 despite the consequences.
 But what was truly frightening was
 how Gon ignored Pouf's taunts,
 calmly moving up the deadline instead.
 How long?
 How long do I have to wait?
 To completely heal her
 will take three to four hours.
 No, I can't wait that long.
 If I have an hour,
 I can heal her most critical injuries.
 Originally, to protect Komugi
 and heal her completely,
 Pitou had deliberately named a longer
 time frame than was necessary,
 which Gon had denied.
 So the hour that they'd agreed
 upon was the actual time
 Pitou believed necessary for Komugi
 to make a full recovery.
 However,
 Doctor Blythe had grown stronger over time.
 It may have been possible
 to speed up the treatment by ten minutes.
 Upon thinking this, Pitou realized...
 It may have been mere coincidence,
 but it was likely that Gon had only chosen ten
 minutes to conform with Pouf's parting words.
 Despite that likelihood, Pitou
 could not shake a bad feeling.
 I must risk my life.
 Or else his fangs
 may reach the King's throat!
 I understand.
 Knuckle.
 I'll be fine here alone.
 I said that Pouf was lying,
 but it's probably true that his main
 body is headed for the King.
 The King is to the south.
 Gon and Killua had seen everything
 that had transpired.
 But since Pitou did not know that,
 it was only natural to assume that Gon
 had seen through Pouf's plans.
 Pitou's worst fears had been confirmed.
 Pitou was now fully resolved to
 complete the mission at hand.
 I must kill him.
 No matter the cost!
 I must kill him...
 For the King's sake!
 Do I move as soon as Komugi is healed?
 No, that won't work.
 I can't expose her to danger.
 First, I must entrust her to someone else.
 Pouf and Youpi dislike Komugi.
 This won't do.
 If I'm gone, who will take Komugi to the King?
 Gon,
 I understand what you're saying.
 However...
 I will still do things my way.
 Youpi is...
 No, never mind.
 If Knuckle's information made Gon hesitant,
 it could result in his death.
 See ya.
 Knuckle managed to stop himself.
 How would you know my name?
 My subordinates were present at the
 moment of your mother's passing.
 She uttered your name with her dying breath.
 And my subordinates may have died
 fighting your Royal Guard by now.
 Interested in fighting me now?
 If you can force me to admit defeat,
 I will tell you your name.
 Force you to admit defeat without killing you?
 So, similar to a bishop and rook handicap...
 No matter.
 I shall checkmate you shortly.
 As the King moved into his stance,
 Netero took to the air.
 When was it...
 that I began to wait for my opponent to attack?
 Whenever you're ready,
 come at me.
 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva...

 Ninety-ninth Hand!
 When was it
 that I stopped hesitating to be gracious,
 taking the hands of vanquished opponents
 when they bowed their heads in defeat?
 That cannot be
 the ultimate power I sought!
 It is fighting with all my soul against
 an opponent with the strength to defeat me!
 This is a tomb.
 Your tomb.
 I am very thankful.
 Thankful for everything
 that has made our meeting possible!

 But it feels like you were always with me.

 Zero x And x Rose
 As his time was compressed to its utmost limits,
 the King, his consciousness alone barely following
 the afterimages of Netero's movements,
 found that a single emotion reigned within him...
 Complete and utter admiration for his enemy.
 That's it.
 He brings his hands together to start the attack.
 That's the only motion he has
 that far surpasses my speed.
 Such wasted movement could
 cost one's life in battle,
 but now, it works as a weapon
 that may allow him to defeat me.
 Trying to guess what drove
 him to do this is pointless.
 It would have required choosing
 a path that defies reason.
 I would presume that, at one point,
 he was on the verge of madness...
 Five years... Perhaps ten years...
 And the entire time, he focused on this alone.
 I recognize that
 you have dedicated an incredible amount of time
 to achieve the power you have displayed.
 After all that, he's barely been scratched.
 Not that I expected any different.
 An individual
 can reach his limit after much training.
 You are a rare example of one
 who has transcended that limit.
 Bravo.
 You have earned my praise.
 An insect
 should not talk down to humans!
 The King's strategy was quite simple.
 Keep attacking.
 If the only attack capable of besting him,
 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva,
 could do next to no damage,
 the King had no cause for fear.
 These are no more than dummy hands.
 They can only move in set patterns.
 If I attack from an angle that he can't
 block with a move he's already used,
 he'll have no choice but to reveal a new move.
 Once I have verified all of the combinations,
 I can find the angle of attack that will
 force him to reveal another new move.
 However, while he may have a limited
 number of attack patterns,
 the number of combinations they can
 be used in may as well be infinite.
 But every individual has a rhythm.
 There will be an unconscious bias for,
 and against, certain patterns,
 and that bias naturally shapes one's identity.
 If I can identify his personal rhythm,
 I have a fair chance of guessing
 which patterns he will select.
 To find the single correct needle
 among countless millions,
 and thread it accurately...
 is what it will take to pierce my target.
 It may prove difficult...
 But I will succeed.
 I can accomplish it!
 Old soldier, I beg of you...
 Don't lose your life before I succeed!
 He's laughing?
 Well, I'm also enjoying myself, so I can't blame him.
 No matter my attack trajectory,
 he recovers immediately and moves to counter.
 If I make a wrong move, his speed won't
 allow me time to unleash the next Hand.
 If I lose focus, he'll tear me
 apart before I realize it.
 This is a contest of endurance, in which
 I must keep choosing correctly...
 When I fail, you win.
 That's probably what you're thinking, Ant King!
 No matter.
 I shall checkmate you shortly.
 Checkmate me if you can.
 I'll show you my Zero Hand!
 After hundreds and thousands of hits,
 the King was beginning to feel the slightest
 hints of dull pain within his body.
 However...
 Stop the bleeding.
 Then tell me my name.
 You have done well for a human.
 What's wrong?
 If you don't act, you'll die of blood loss.
 Don't make me laugh.
 I'll die?
 You shouldn't get cocky after
 landing a lucky punch...
 The battle's just begun!
 You have truly earned my admiration.
 I am amazed that your spirit has not flagged.
 However, losing your leg was basically inevitable.
 It is the consequence of using a defense that,
 while not bad, was not the best choice.
 After playing against Komugi, I learned
 the art of anticipating enemy actions.
 Your unconscious bias against certain patterns
 gives me insight into the otherwise
 limitless options you have.
 Next, I'll take your left arm.
 The ensuing fight
 did not even last a minute.
 This is
 my life's final act!
 As he released his 100-Type, Netero's resolve
 heightened his physical and mental senses,
 resulting in an exchange of more
 than a thousand punches,
 and sparking countless fireworks
 between the combatants.
 And then, the moment arrived.
 His attacks began to show a slight inclination,
 one not quite significant enough
 to be called a habit or bias.
 After using his body to bear the
 brunt of Netero's attacks,
 the King was able to find
 the faint light beyond, and...
 he reached it.
 Are you satisfied now?
 Then tell me my name.
 Ant King...
 You believe I cannot pray with a single arm?
 A prayer comes from the heart.
 If the heart achieves the correct
 form, it becomes emotion...
 And emotions may be manifested.
 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva Zero Hand
 was a Buddha that appeared behind an enemy,
 gently enveloping the target
 with an indiscriminate love.
 Previously, Killua had sensed its murderous
 intent from a great distance away.
 Not this way!
 It had left such a strong impact,
 Killua had changed his direction.
 The entirety of Netero's aura
 was transformed into a light as
 blinding as a star, and fired
 with a merciless roar.
 The pinnacle of individual strength.
 That was a magnificent attack.
 Zero wasn't enough?
 I was born to be King of the Ants,
 to rule over all organisms.
 I represent the instinctive hope
 long nurtured by my species,
 and that species continues to evolve for my sake.
 I stand here now, the resulting boon
 of the total support of my species.
 You are an individual human, not a king...
 I am the King that bears his kind's fate.
 That was the difference in this battle.
 The Chimera Ants' long evolution
 has culminated in me.
 This is a feat the human race, with its
 individuality, can never match.
 However, humans will no longer
 be used to propagate our species.
 We have learned that
 the strong human ego disrupts
 the bonds between Ants.
 Out of respect for your efforts,
 I shall allow humans to permanently
 survive within a special zone.
 We shall reevaluate the number and
 quality of humans to be used as food.
 Your lonely battle was not in vain...
 I shall not repeat myself again.
 Tell me my name.
 I am not alone.
 Don't underestimate the human race, Meruem.
 Meruem... That is your name.
 As Netero spoke the King's name,
 the King had no time to consider it,
 as he watched the old man who was
 supposed to be surrendering.
 What is this?
 Meruem, King of Ants,
 you understand nothing...
 of humanity's infinite potential for evolution!
 It was the first time the King had felt fear.
 One look at the face of this beaten old man,
 who should have been waiting for death,
 made it clear that his seemingly
 vain words were no mere boast.
 Should your heart stop beating, this will activate.
 If there is a hell, I'll see you there.
 I see now...
 Yes... I see...
 You had me in checkmate
 from the start...
 The bomb was both low-budget and compact,
 while also proving surprisingly lethal.
 With the right technology,
 it was possible to quickly mass
 produce these bombs.
 Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,
 it was called the Miniature Rose,
 or the poor man's rose,
 and was popular with small dictatorships.
 Next time: Hostility x And x Determination.
 No matter what happens,
 I won't betray my friends.
 No matter what happens,
 I'll believe in my friends.
 Thank you, Chairman Netero.

 Hostility x And x Determination
 The bomb was both low-budget and compact,
 while also proving surprisingly lethal.
 With the right technology,
 it was possible to quickly mass
 produce these bombs.
 Due to the shape of the smoke cloud,
 it was called the Miniature Rose,
 or the poor man's rose,
 and was popular with small dictatorships.
 In more than 250 countries and regions of the world,
 ten times as many roses had bloomed,
 consuming 5.12 million human lives.
 After terrorists used the bomb in the
 center of an adversarial nation's capital,
 taking more than 110,000 lives,
 an international treaty was signed that
 banned the bomb's production.
 However, over eighty percent of the
 world's countries rejected the proposal
 to discard and ban the use of
 roses they had already produced,
 meaning that hundreds of thousands of seeds
 still wait silently in many countries
 for their chance to bloom.
 ""How are humans and Ants different?""
 When Netero decided to use his last resort,
 could this thought have crossed his mind?
 Now, there is no way to find out.
 The two immediately understood
 what the distant cloud of smoke and
 resulting vibration in the air signified.
 At the same time,
 Pouf's clone found itself looking Knuckle in the eye.
 After his experience with Youpi,
 Knuckle hoped to reach a
 similar understanding with Pouf.
 But his faint hopes were quickly shattered.
 If the King waves his baton,
 the soldiers will become demons if necessary.
 Pouf's main body must have learned
 that something happened to the King.
 That led to the transformation of the clone's
 face, revealing the Ants' true nature.
 Did the chairman defeat the King?
 No, it doesn't matter either way...
 In Pouf's face, Knuckle had seen a barrier
 that could not be overcome.
 It's destroyed!
 Is everyone okay?
 This is brutal...
 It only took them thirty minutes
 to wreck the whole place.
 That was close...
 Ikalgo.
 Killua!
 Palm...
 I see.
 But I'm glad to see you.
 You returned to us.
 Then, as planned, I'll take you to Peijing by car.
 No, she wants to stay.
 Well, she'll certainly be useful in a fight.
 In terms of raw offensive power,
 she has me beat...
 Probably.
 To be honest, I want to go to Gon at once.
 However...
 I'll wait.
 I'll respect his wishes...
 His wishes?
 He's decided to fight Pitou by himself.
 I'll wait right here for one hour.
 And once he's made up his mind,
 that's it. He won't budge.
 In return, he performs his best
 when circumstances are as expected.
 Which means all we can do is stay out of his way.
 B-But what if...
 Yeah, I know.
 If he gets into serious trouble,
 we'll immediately rush in to help him.
 I see...
 So that's why they're staying behind.
 Even if Gon uses all the power he currently has,
 he still won't be able to beat Pitou.
 In fact, even if the three of us join him,
 they're aware that we're still no match for Pitou.
 They're staying behind
 to die with him!
 We're also looking for Knuckle and the others.
 Want to come?
 Absolutely.
 Okay, let's go.
 We separated the King and the Royal Guard
 to let the chairman defeat the King.
 As Knov-san said, we've completed
 the mission we were assigned.
 Each of us will have to decide
 where we go from here.
 Do we stop or keep going?
 I am
 going to keep fighting them.
 I've already laid down my life here more than once.
 Even if we can't reach an understanding,
 I won't give up until I'm content with the outcome.
 You're finished.
 Why did he say that?
 There's still time left...
 Did he notice that my surgery was done?
 I made sure to hide my progress from him.
 But if I showed any sign of
 relaxing after finishing it,
 and he noticed that...
 I must kill him.
 No matter the cost!
 I must kill him...
 For the King's sake!
 Did he notice my bloodlust then?
 Stand up.
 We move to Peijing now.
 Running is faster for us.
 What happened to me?
 I would like to—
 The next time you try to delay me, I'll kill her.
 S-Sorry!
 Am I interrupting something?
 U-Um, I don't understand what's going on...
 I understand.
 Let's go.
 Pitou was close enough to take
 off his head with one arm.
 But Pitou couldn't move.
 After seeing how sharp Gon's senses were,
 Pitou's instincts said to obey.
 I can't make a move now...
 My chance will come.
 There'll be many, on our way to Peijing.
 But I must get Komugi to the King!
 Gon, want me to use Chapter 7
 Bankruptcy on Pitou?
 If there's an escape attempt,
 I can track Pitou down.
 And if Pitou tries to fight back,
 APR will protect you.
 Thank you, Knuckle.
 But it's okay.
 I trust Pitou...
 So until Pitou and I have met with Kite,
 keep an eye on her.
 A-Are you talking about me?
 Is he going to use Komugi...
 As a hostage?!
 Once Pitou turns Kite back, we'll let her go.
 I'm sure you're also willing to trust me, right?
 Pitou?
 You sure about this, Killua?
 You aren't going with Gon?
 We were...
 No, Killua was prepared to die with Gon.
 But Gon didn't want him to come!
 Pitou and I will go by ourselves.
 It's okay.
 That was always the plan.
 And I feel better after hearing what he's doing.
 You mean the hostage?
 Yeah. The real danger would be if I went along,
 and Pitou managed to capture me.
 Then Pitou would have the option
 to exchange hostages.
 Seriously...
 What have they been through for
 their minds to work this way?
 It's all right.
 Now that I've seen Gon with these eyes,
 I'll know immediately if something happens.
 Besides, Pitou won't abandon her.
 Which means that Gon is safe.
 I can't understand what's going on.
 Where is the Supreme Leader?
 Who are these people?
 The heat of the explosion had
 melted the rock into magma,
 leaving a scene resembling the
 mouth of an active volcano,
 producing a perpetual cloud of black smoke
 that prevented the living from entering.
 Pouf!
 I'll search inside, so I need you to
 search the surrounding area.
 It's possible that the explosion
 sent the King flying.
 I was wrong...
 We will kill them all, with the King at our side.
 None will be spared!

 Youpi's roar had an ominous tone.
 Before he could even see the truth for himself,
 tears were already streaming down Pouf's face.

 and having shared their own beings with the King,
 Pouf and Youpi had at last reached
 the pinnacle of their species...
 The level of Queen.
 It's clear that his strength has increased.
 He's even stronger now!
 Our bodies have helped the King...
 And become part of him.

 How do you feel?
 Should we return to the palace first?
 If you wish for more of that food,
 we can provide it.
 In a few minutes, my clones will arrive.
 Food...
 Ah...
 Then that taste was real.
 As I wandered through the light,
 I heard someone call my name.
 Calling, ""Meruem.""
 I do not know if that was a dream or reality.
 I cannot remember why
 I am here.
 Meruem-sama...
 You've lost your memory?
 I feel fine.
 In fact, I am brimming with energy.
 But my mind is hazy...
 Why have your appearances changed?
 We sent our clones to scout the area.
 They are searching for remaining
 enemies to dispose of—
 You may have my best interests in mind.
 But when you lie to me, you betray me.
 You will not get a second chance.
 So, I was eating you.
 We offered ourselves to you!
 We know we acted beyond our places!
 But we made the decision!
 What happened? Give me an explanation.
 Before we can do that,
 I must ask you one question.
 It appears that you recall
 our former appearances.
 Do you remember the day
 we first began serving you?
 I do not.
 I recognized that you were my
 Royal Guards Pouf and Youpi
 the moment I saw you.
 No, I should say I remembered that you were.
 However, I cannot recall anything
 about how that came to be.
 Meruem-sama...
 I believe you are suffering from temporary
 memory loss due to the explosion.
 Explosion?
 Yes.
 You came here to engage
 in a duel with the enemy.
 However, the cowardly human
 resorted to the underhanded
 trick of using a powerful bomb,
 betraying your honorable intentions!
 A duel...
 Yes...
 I was
 fighting a duel.
 We knew that, given your power and fortune,
 a mere human weapon could
 never deal a lethal blow.
 However, we could not bear
 to see you in that state.
 So we did what we could to speed your recovery,
 knowing full well that we might be punished.
 Our bodies have always been yours.
 We were simply returning them to you.
 Let's return to the palace!
 That will be the fastest way
 for you to regain your memory!
 This is
 my perfect
 chance!
 If I return to the palace first,
 I can dispose of her!
 At the moment, the King does not remember her.
 If I eliminate her now,
 he will never have the chance to remember her!
 This will require...
 Convincing Pitou?
 Getting rid of that meddling human?
 No...
 The first thing to do
 is to end her life.
 If I kill her, everything else will fall into place.
 The King will need twenty
 minutes to reach the palace,
 and that is if he runs at full speed.
 I have enough time to kill her.
 This feels as natural as though
 I was born with these.
 I will learn to fly in no time.
 Which way to the palace?
 North.
 You should be able to make
 it in fifteen minutes!
 It's there.
 The answer I seek is in the palace.
 He is fast!
 If I waste too much time, he'll catch up!
 Fifteen minutes?
 No, at this speed, he'll arrive in five minutes...
 I have but two to three minutes.
 Quickly, my clones!
 This is a gamble.
 Once the King sees the millions
 of humans outside the palace,
 he will remember everything!
 Remember that his objective
 is to rule all living creatures!
 So long as he doesn't see that woman!
 As a Royal Guard...
 As one who has inherited the Queen's will...
 I must eliminate that lowly human girl!
 She's gone!
 Where is she?

 My power was not meant for me.
 It was meant to be used by the King!
 Youpi.
 This does not make sense.
 If you knew this power resulted
 from an enemy's attack,
 that means either you saw it used,
 or it was used on you.
 Which was it?
 I was hit by an attack.
 I cannot see it following you now.
 So why does the enemy still live?
 How did you free yourself
 from the enemy's power?
 Answer me.
 We made an agreement.
 In exchange for releasing me from his power,
 I agreed to spare his comrade.
 Then, after he released you,
 you had the opportunity to finish
 him off along with his comrade.
 Why did you not do so?
 Honestly, I'm not sure.
 I believe I felt that, if I had,
 I would have lost in some way.
 I felt that breaking a promise,
 even a promise to an enemy,
 would be equivalent to conceding defeat.
 Impossible!
 You're saying that your personal emotions
 were the reason you spared the lives
 of those who oppose the King?
 I'm prepared to accept any punishment...
 I have no excuses to offer.
 I only ordered that you not lie to me.
 I have no reason to punish
 those who speak the truth.
 Pouf.
 Yes!
 Youpi.
 Yes!
 We have all obtained rather inconvenient bodies.
 Our bodies and souls have been linked...
 It is no longer possible for the three of
 us to hide anything from one another!
 Your Majesty!
 Your Majesty...
 Let us go.
 Yes!
 Your Majesty...
 Was that meant as a final warning
 because you realize what I plan to do,
 and the guilt it makes me feel?
 Nevertheless!
 Even if it means I am executed for my crime...
 I do this for the King!
 Where is she? Find her!
 Hurry up and find her!
 For the sake of our species!
 Where is she?
 Find her!
 She is not necessary!
 Find her, quickly!
 I do this for the King.
 Is she over there?
 Wait! Not there!
 No! That way!
 Hey!
 When you're split up, you can't hurt me.
 You're ignoring me?
 Wait up!
 You can't remove APR without defeating me!
 Youpi, the enemy suddenly appeared before me.
 Does the enemy who attached this
 also have the ability to teleport?
 That's someone else...
 There's one who can make himself
 and those around him invisible.
 He looks like a chameleon.
 I don't know his name, but he's
 one of the Squadron Leaders.
 Which means he's a traitor!
 So you spared not only humans,
 but a traitor, as well?
 I'm willing to accept any punishment.
 Your Majesty!
 Until we've defeated them, please...
 I do not care. It is irrelevant.
 On the contrary, I believe that this is a trial
 that Chimera Ants must overcome to evolve.
 Youpi...
 We must accept your emotional instability,
 as well as the traitor's betrayal,
 as we move forward.
 Humans are a sacrifice meant to help
 us attain the next level of evolution.
 The perfect sacrifice.
 Once we arrive at the pinnacle of evolution,
 any lingering traces of the human ego will
 be nothing more than a minor wild-card trait.
 The King's opinion had completely
 reversed following the explosion.
 Was it due to the impact?
 No.
 This was the King, as well.
 If the enemy can become invisible,
 I can find him by making contact.
 I need to split myself
 into the smallest clones
 that can still retain sight,
 and expand the search!
 Bastard...
 Clearly, I'm not his target.
 He turned back just like that... Who is he after?
 Is he looking for the traitor, Meleoron?
 That's bad, then!
 I can't think of any way to defeat the
 King without Meleoron's ability...
 I must protect Meleoron at any cost!
 Pouf divided his clones to the point where
 they're too small for me to see.
 Unlike his main body, his clones have to be
 at full size for me to see them.
 The man with the pompadour
 was obviously just a decoy.
 They must know we've realized
 that the chameleon is a traitor.
 In other words, they believe that I've
 returned to dispose of the traitor.
 Assuming the chameleon is concealing
 himself and the others as they flee,
 and that the woman is among them,
 if I get close, they will protect the
 chameleon and abandon her!
 Because they believe the
 chameleon is my target.
 They must have never imagined that I'd return
 to kill the woman that Pitou was
 trying so desperately to heal.
 If they believe I've returned to rescue
 the woman, it's even better!
 They may even offer to hand her
 over to me with conditions.
 He must be after Meleoron.
 Since, from their perspective, he's a traitor.
 Hold on.
 Let's make sure.
 The door leading underground?
 So that's it...
 They realized that I know they
 can become invisible,
 and decided to give me two options.
 The chameleon either ran inside
 or fled somewhere else.
 Their plan is to split up my clones
 further, to weaken me.
 No! Over there! Over there!
 Over there! Over there! Over there!
 What?
 They're giving me two options.
 But they're to pursue the traitor or the woman?
 Then they want to know which is my target?
 Do I split up my clones, to hide my objective?
 Or do I send the majority of them after
 the chameleon, to fool them?
 Even if the shutter is closed,
 I can slip through it if my clones are particle-sized.
 No, I don't have time for that!
 I'll go after
 the woman!
 So she's his target?
 I only have to kill the woman
 and hide her body from the
 King for a short time.
 My clone can manage that!
 I only need a minute or two!
 He's...
 incredibly fast!
 Then she's your target?
 I'm up for a game of tag.
 I can go all night.
 Judging by how quickly he reacted,
 it would be hard to catch him,
 even at full strength.
 If I don't hurry, the King will arrive.
 What do I do?
 Out of options, Pouf arrived at a diabolical solution.
 I know!
 The greatest magic of all...
 He split himself up?
 But he won't be big enough to take her away!
 Is he going to attack me first?
 Your plan is going to backfire...
 You've reduced your speed and power,
 so I don't even need to use Godspeed.
 Cease this futile resistance.
 Your plans have already been thwarted!
 What is the point in adding
 to your transgressions?
 If it is fear of retribution driving
 you to flee, you needn't worry.
 The King will forgive you.
 He is a benevolent ruler.
 Don't make me laugh!
 You think I'll believe that?
 You'll probably tie me to a tree,
 and turn me into a soldier!
 The King?
 That's right...
 Keep running.
 Take her far from the King first!
 That confirms it...
 I don't know the reason,
 but this girl is important to the King.
 For Gon... For the sake of our mission...
 I can't let the enemy have her!
 That's right...
 The person chasing us sounded like
 one of the people with the Supreme Leader...
 Does that mean the King is the Supreme Leader?
 Then who is this person?
 Who are the people he was with?
 Your twisted sense of justice
 will never help the people!
 First, I cast a spell on the woman.
 I use magic words to make her suspicious...
 The King and I seek open dialogue.
 Now, release her at once!
 Bastard... That's just a bunch of baloney.
 What is he up to?
 Let me go...
 Please put me down!
 Something's wrong with you!
 You're all tingly!
 What are you talking about, fool?
 I'm trying to save you!
 You're lying!
 I'm lying?
 You trust that insect more than you trust me?
 Insect?
 What are you talking about?!
 That's right... She can't see!
 Let go! Let me go!
 That'll make it hard to explain.
 Damn... Almost.
 It didn't take long for the poison to kick in.
 If the woman you're carrying resists,
 your speed will also fall...
 What's going on?
 He wasn't aiming for me...
 He was aiming for the woman.
 He was trying to kill her!
 If she escapes, that's fine.
 If she distracts him with her resistance,
 allowing me to kill her, even better!
 Komugi-san!
 The enemies consider you a valuable hostage.
 They will not kill you...
 Keep struggling!
 Keep fighting back!
 I'll save you soon!
 She was knocked out, so that's impossible.
 Well, I have no idea what's going on here,
 but I know that you're making me mad.
 If you enter this ring,
 I'll kill you.
 You may be a clone,
 but you were formed from the original's cells.
 If I burn those cells, they die.
 Electricity...
 Come on... I'll whittle you down.
 Are you having difficulty?
 I can feel your impatience.
 I shall lend you a hand.
 It's nothing you need to worry about.
 Your first priority should be regaining
 your memories, Meruem-sama.
 Once my main body has returned,
 I can deal with the intruders easily.
 Anyway... Behold, Meruem-sama!
 Humans, as far as we can see!
 Do you remember now?
 They are all here for you...
 They all belong to you!
 They belong to me?
 You will rule these dumb, inferior creatures,
 and stand atop the food chain.
 That is your glorious destiny!
 As willed by the heavens!
 Something isn't right...
 There's still something else...
 Something else I've forgotten.
 What are you saying?
 Nothing could be more important
 than ruling over all life forms...
 I suppose.
 Perhaps the explosion has left me confused.
 However...
 The pain won't cease.
 Why is the palace in shambles?
 It was destroyed in the battle.
 It happened after you left the palace.
 Where is the place I spent most of my time in?
 It has been completely destroyed...
 I suppose I should look at what's left.
 Yes, you may find something that will
 help you regain your memories...
 This is bad!
 That could be it...
 The Gungi board and pieces!
 They may be the key to awakening his memory!
 I must dispose of them!
 He gave up?
 Over there.
 Let's go.
 Next time: Magic x Of x Despair.
 Killua, thanks.
 What's this about?
 We're buddies, right?
 Yeah, but still...
 Thanks.

 Magic x Of x Despair
 He's back.
 The King has returned.
 Hey, aren't we too close?
 It's okay...
 We aren't close enough to trigger APR's timer.
 The problem will be when
 the King and Pouf split up.
 Should I remove APR from Pouf,
 and use it on the King?
 These are known as human grapes.
 The humans fit to become
 soldiers wait here to hatch.

 Where is Welfin?
 These won't work.
 When the bodies are ripped apart,
 I can't use Living Dead Dolls.
 Killua...
 The King has arrived at the palace's entrance!
 Yeah.
 We should circle around, following the wall,
 and hide in the crowd.
 Okay.
 What about Gon and Pitou?
 They just entered the Peijing hiding place.
 They're walking down a hallway.
 How does that crystal work now?
 You can also see Pouf and me in it?
 Yes, looking from a bit above.
 Wink Blue uses my crystal ball
 to remember people seen through my right eye.
 Looking through only my left eye,
 I can watch those people's current
 positions in the crystal ball.
 At the moment, the crystal ball
 is simultaneously showing
 Gon and Pitou, Killua and me,
 as well as Pouf, the King, and Youpi.
 It's like watching a TV screen
 that's been split up.
 However, my right eye has only
 seen Pouf, you, and Gon.
 So I can only see the others when
 they're around one of you.
 And I can only use my power to
 watch three people at once.
 If I see someone else with my right eye,
 I won't be able to see the oldest
 of the three targets, Pouf.
 I'm not sure you need to keep watching Pouf.
 If you can only see his main body,
 and his clones are scattered,
 it's probably more a minus than a plus.
 Is that so?
 If I can only see his main body,
 that also means I won't be fooled by clones.
 And if his main body is only the size
 of a fly, I can literally crush him.
 Our chance to defeat Pouf is while he's divided.
 What greater plus is there?
 So they figured me out.
 Then I just need to use that against them.
 Walk forward.
 It's the right door, at the end.
 Even with all the noise echoing in the old castle,
 Pitou's hearing was sharp
 enough to pick up the voice
 on a cell phone hidden in a pocket.
 Pitou-sama, this is Welfin.
 I will keep this as brief as I can.
 Brovada and I have retaken the girl.
 Intruders are still around,
 so we're taking refuge beneath the palace.
 I will let you hear her voice.
 Hello? Pitou-sama?
 This is Komugi.
 I'm fine, so don't worry.
 Got it...
 Goodbye.
 Was that good?
 Yes.
 If possible,
 can you get me a doctor, Pouf-dono?
 It's him, right?
 Since I can split myself at the cellular level,
 I can also become different people.
 I can replicate faces, bodies, even voices.
 Now, Pitou is also under my spell...
 The spell of the lie that will
 free Pitou from that curse.
 So, keep watching Gon and Pitou.
 You should see something interesting soon...
 Now, heal Kite, like you promised.
 Once that's done, I'll release her.
 Your name...
 What is your name?
 Gon.
 Gon Freecss.
 Gon...
 You listened to my request.
 So I will be honest with you.
 He is
 already
 dead.
 Dead?
 He died during our fight.
 I remember now.
 Back then, you were...
 I was unable to revive one who was dead.
 My power could only prevent
 the body from decomposing,
 and control its movements.
 His soul is no longer here.
 There is no way to heal him.
 I am sorry.
 Palm...
 Yes?
 Thank you.
 What? What's this?
 What are you thanking me for?
 Stuff...
 Stuff? Such as?
 Drop it! Stuff just means stuff!
 What was that?
 It seems wrong to make me mad
 while you're thanking me!
 Don't worry... I'll never say thanks again.
 Because now we're friends.
 I never say thanks to my friends.
 Anyway, how's Gon?
 Y-Yes, that's right...
 What's wrong?
 It can't be...
 What's going on?!
 Kite...
 Kite is...
 dead.
 Man, forced to take another life...
 You've grown, Gon.
 If I...
 If I...
 Whether we win or lose,
 hell lies ahead of us.
 If I hadn't gone with him...
 Kite wouldn't have died.
 It was...
 It was my fault.
 It was because I tagged along...
 It was really my fault...
 Get away from me!
 It's my fault that Kite is...
 No... It isn't my fault!
 Pitou's the one who killed him!
 Not me!
 But it was me...
 It was me....
 I killed Kite.
 It's my fault...
 No! It's Pitou's fault!
 But it's really my fault.
 Kite is alive!
 He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
 Kite is dead...
 Kite is dead.
 Kite is dead.
 Kite is dead...
 Kite is dead!
 Help...
 Someone help...
 Kite is... Kite is...
 Kite is... Kite is...
 Kite...
 Just wait a little longer.
 I'll get you back to normal soon.
 I can't get him back to normal.
 Kite is gone...
 It's my fault.
 Someone help...
 Someone help Kite—
 No! No! No! No! No!
 But... But...
 But...
 But... But... But... But...
 But...
 Doctor Blythe.
 What?
 Pitou's going to help Kite?
 Oh, it's true...
 Kite being dead was a lie.
 Pitou will heal him.
 Huh?
 Why is it healing Pitou's arm?
 Turn Kite back to normal.
 Please...
 After you finish what you're doing.
 Why? What's going on?!
 What's wrong? What happened, Palm?
 I don't know...
 I can only see what's happening...
 But something is wrong with Gon!
 What's wrong?!
 Pitou is healing itself, not Kite.
 Gon is slumped on the floor next to Pitou.
 Impossible...
 As long as she's in our hands, Pitou...
 Pitou has to obey us!
 Please...
 Help Kite.

 going to heal Kite...
 Liar.
 What?
 What is this?
 I don't care
 if this is the end...
 So...
 I'll use everything.
 I was right.
 His power is now equal
 to that of the King!
 I'll kill you,
 Pitou!
 Terpsichora!
 Exceed your limits,
 and dance!
 I must stop him here!
 It can't be!
 Is he heading for the King?
 Come.
 I don't want to destroy this place.
 This way.
 Follow me.
 I don't know how he did it,
 but he's forced his body to mature to a point
 at which he's able to defeat me.
 First comes
 rock...
 Rock.
 Paper.
 Rock.
 Sinking deeply into unconsciousness,
 Pitou felt a sense of relief.
 Thank goodness...
 This power could only be achieved through
 the sacrifice of his own life energy.
 He's prepared to never use Nen again.
 That was the resolve required
 to perform this feat.
 An enemy blessed with immense talent
 has been forced to exchange all
 of that talent for this power.
 I'm so glad
 I am the one
 that he will kill...
 Having used Speed of Lightning to race
 to Gon, Killua arrived to hear...
 Which one of them is doing that?
 Gon!
 And what he found was...
 A silhouette that looked nothing
 like the person he'd known,
 swinging a fist, bloodied from countless punches,
 downward toward the skull
 of an already-broken Pitou...
 Rock.
 Paper.
 ...for the final, shattering blow.
 Kite...
 I finished the job, the way you taught me to.
 So...
 Gon,
 is that you?
 Killua...
 Having seen Gon's appearance,
 Killua immediately thought of Bisky.
 But he realized the difference at once.
 Bisky's appearance changed,
 but there wasn't a massive increase
 in the aura contained within her.
 And in Bisky's case,
 she was merely reverting to her original form.
 But Gon's done the opposite!
 How many years?
 More than ten?
 Decades?
 This would have been the result
 of years of endless training.
 What price did he have to pay
 to obtain so much aura?
 Pitou's devotion to the King was so great
 that even after death, Terpsichora clad
 itself in even more powerful Nen,
 transforming Pitou into a corpse puppet
 ready to leap forward in pursuit of its prey,
 its sole purpose to kill Gon.
 In that fraction of a second,
 shorter than the blink of an eye,
 Killua heard Gon speak.
 It's okay.
 It doesn't hurt.
 I'm not trying to be tough.
 I'm kind of happy...
 I finally
 get to be the same
 as Kite was then.
 Gon...
 I feel like
 I've been redeemed some.
 You can have my right arm.
 First comes rock...
 Gon!
 It's time for you
 to sleep, too.
 Stop...
 You can't!
 If you keep using this power,
 what will happen to you?
 Rock.
 Paper.
 Gon!

132,"As Gon was dedicating all of his
 power to finishing off Neferpitou,
 Meruem, Pouf, and Youpi were
 inside the west tower, where Komugi had been.
 Once we're through here...
 The west tower's second floor.
 Once we've passed this area,
 the King will never remember her!
 As long as I don't give him
 an opportunity to see her...
 Flash x And x Start
 Something is missing...
 But what is it?
 I don't know.
 I know...
 I won't say anything.
 I agree that we shouldn't let the King see her.
 Ideally, he should stay as he is now.
 I have
 a feeling that something is
 missing from this place.
 Though it may just be a side
 effect of my memory loss.
 Exactly...
 Your memory can be verified
 through what you see.
 Which means you can recover all
 of the memories you need.
 I believe the selection was to begin at 12:00.
 Yes.
 However, that can be moved up.
 By 9:00,
 the remaining humans will be gathered
 in the plain before the palace.
 What is it?
 I have not used my scales
 on the humans still on their way in.
 We don't want them to cause a commotion,
 so I will summon my clones to hypnotize them.
 What will you do, Youpi?
 Right...
 I'll look for Pitou.
 Right now, I don't have the
 strength to protect you.
 Pitou...
 Did you just remember something?
 Oh, yeah... We haven't told
 the King about Pitou yet.
 Meruem-sama, do you remember who Pitou is?
 Yes,
 one of my three Royal Guards.
 I can recall Pitou's appearance so clearly,
 it seems a mystery that I
 didn't remember it until now.
 So words can also trigger his memory,
 not just images...
 We cannot let him hear her name.
 We must be very careful...
 The key will be convincing Pitou.
 I know...
 Tell Pitou to keep quiet, right?
 There it is again...
 I'm counting on you.
 Yes...
 I...
 asked Pitou
 to do something for me.
 Youpi.
 Yes...
 Bring Pitou to me at once.
 Yes.
 What will you do, Meruem-sama?
 Enemies are still around.
 Indeed...
 As I search for Pitou myself,
 I shall hunt down the remaining intruders.
 This is bad!
 Your Majesty, that would be...
 It is merely for entertainment.
 And I am sure these enemies
 have useful information.
 However, we won't be at your side,
 and we don't know what enemies remainâ€”
 I want an honest answer,
 Pouf.
 Do you believe there is a chance
 that these intruders could get the better of me?!
 No...
 Absolutely not.
 Th-This exceeds my expectations...
 The King...
 Meruem-sama...
 is the ultimate being.
 That much is certain!
 The overwhelming aura
 left Knuckle and the rest, still concealed,
 in total despair.
 Th-This isn't something we can deal with...
 To handle this, you'd need an entire
 nation's military might.
 Meleoron, we're making a run for it!
 Seriously?
 You bet!
 We'll head back to Peijing under
 the cover of this crowd!
 What about Killua, Ikalgo, and the others?
 There's nothing we can do!
 If they can see that, they'll understand.
 They'll run away, too.
 That's the only option.
 That isn't...
 something we can handle.
 But if you and I team up...
 We could land one attack, sure.
 And we could probably attach APR.
 But...
 APR only adds interest if I'm within fifty meters!
 If we're within fifty meters of him...
 Do you think we'd last long
 enough for him to go bust?
 You'd have to have lungs as strong as the boss's!
 The situation's changed...
 The enemy knows about our powers!
 They can prepare for us.
 I was an idiot.
 We needed to notify the Association
 right away of the chairman's defeat,
 so they could immediately initiate
 the next plan of action.
 Hurry!
 Revenge and duty...
 The difference in motivations
 between Meleoron and Knuckle
 placed growing distance between
 them as they walked.
 At that moment...
 Meruem's En lit up the palace and the
 surrounding area in a literal flash.
 Sensing there were two enemies nearby,
 he began with Knuckle.
 Next was Meleoron, who had barely thought
 that he should activate his power
 when he was knocked out.
 Where's the King?
 It disappeared!
 I shall be interrogating them.
 Once I am done, do as you like.
 There were two other Nen users whose aura
 reacted to my En.
 One of them must be carrying
 the unconscious Komugi.
 What do I do? What do I do?
 I must stop the King...
 Your Majesty!
 If your purpose is entertainment,
 shouldn't you take your time?
 It appears
 that you have a proposal.
 Yes... Would you be willing
 to engage in a contest with us?
 A contest?
 Again...
 A contest...
 A contest...
 A contest...
 A contest...
 What contest?
 Youpi and I will search for Pitou,
 while you search for the
 two remaining Nen users.
 A contest to see who locates their target first?
 Yes.
 But don't you need to go and spread scales?
 Correct.
 So while I hypnotize the remaining humans,
 I would request that Meruem-sama wait here.
 It is very clear
 that the difference in power between you
 and the intruders is insurmountable.
 Finding and capturing them should
 only take you a few seconds.
 That cannot be called entertainment.
 Meanwhile, we must find Pitou,
 who has engaged an enemy that
 seems capable of teleportation.
 And Pitou's current location is unknown.
 To make up for the difference,
 we request additional time,
 as well as one further handicap.
 One further handicap?
 What is it?
 You are only allowed to use En once more.
 How does that sound?
 Amusing.
 I accept this contest.
 Thank you very much.
 Perfect...
 I can use the extra time to kill that woman!
 As long as we are playing,
 I have a proposal, as well.
 If you win, I shall grant each of you a wish.
 Yes, sir.
 We are very honored.
 And what if you win, Meruem-sama?
 If I win,
 you will tell me what you are hiding from me.
 Your Majesty...
 Silence.
 I already told you...
 You and I are united as one.
 Did you think that I could not sense
 the guilt that you now feel?
 However, I sense that your feelings
 of loyalty are stronger.
 Otherwise, I would have sent
 your heads flying long ago.
 I am certain you have your reasons.
 I shall not ask them...
 Assuming that you beat me.
 You will obtain what you desire,
 and protect your secret.
 You could not wish for better terms...
 Assuming that you beat me.
 Meruem-sama...
 I shall immediately begin to spread
 scales, and not waste a moment.
 If we lose, we will tell you everything.
 I swear it on my life.
 You do not appear to be treating
 this as mere entertainment.
 Once Pouf finishes spreading his
 scales and returns, I shall begin.
 Is that acceptable?
 Yes.
 Victory goes to whomever returns to
 this room with their target first.
 If Pitou should return,
 you are to explain the objective of this contest
 and order Pitou to hide.
 As you wish.
 I shall tell you that
 the two Nen users my En registered
 were an octopus and a human
 carrying some sort of burden.
 I must win.
 No, victory is already assured!
 The question is what to do
 about Pitou and the woman.
 Then...
 Start!
 Where do you think Pitou went?
 It'll be fine! Pitou should return soon!
 Turn around and wait by the west
 tower for Pitou's return.
 Do not allow Pitou near the King!
 You can't use clones while you
 spread your scales, right?
 Then you aren't buying us any time.
 Trust me!
 I'm begging you!
 Unbelievable... Such tremendous aura...
 Those two are dead.
 No,
 they're still alive.
 They were only knocked unconscious...
 Where's Gon?
 Killua's carrying him...
 His hair is long?
 Is it someone else?
 No, those are the only two
 figures in my crystal ball.
 That is Gon!
 Something must have happened
 when I wasn't watching.
 Where's Pitou?
 In any case, don't come back here... Please!
 Pouf is spreading scales on the citizens...
 Are they poisonous?
 It would help me more if he'd stay near the King.
 In any case, he's on the palace's opposite side.
 I must get as far from my
 previous location as I can...
 After that En wave, I immediately used Wink Blue,
 and the King appeared next to Pouf,
 carrying Knuckle and Meleoron.
 Only a few seconds had passed!
 Next, he will pursue Ikalgo or me.
 The King could be standing behind
 me at any moment...
 I must hurry and get farther away...
 Before the King uses En again!
 I must go in there!
 If I'm crossing the plain when he uses En, I won't be able to escape!
 If I'm deep underground,
 perhaps his En won't reach.
 But I'm also trapping myself.
 Should I escape outside the palace,
 and hope that the King doesn't
 make a move for a while?
 There's no reason to expect him not to!
 What should I do?
 What is the right decision?
 Ikalgo!
 I thought you might come here...
 Let's go in! Hurry!
 Yes, but...
 Hurry!
 Isn't that why you came here?
 If he uses En again, we're finished!
 Where's Killua?
 He went after Gon.
 They're together now.
 I don't know what happened to Pitou.
 I see...
 So Meleoron and Knuckle were captured.
 The King is on a whole other level.
 Why do you think their lives were spared?
 Um, well...
 It's possible that I just want
 to think that they're alive...
 They're alive.
 Probably so they can be exchanged.
 You mean the way Killua discussed
 exchanging hostages?
 I'll set a trap...
 I'm not going out without a fight.
 First, we'll hide the girl in Bizeff's room!
 A contest...
 A contest...
 Next time: Deadline x To x Live.
 Killua...
 Don't you dare speak his name!
 You would never understand!
 Killua!

133,"After challenging Meruem to a
 contest in order to buy time,
 Pouf was now scattering scales on the
 citizens who were not yet hypnotized.
 I must hurry or Meruem-sama
 will remember that woman...
 We haven't moved forward at all.
 What's going on up ahead?
 Shh, no talking!
 What are you talking about?
 The soldiers are held up in the back.
 I heard all their commanders have
 collapsed, one after another...
 Like puppets whose strings have been cut.
 There haven't been any warnings
 about stepping out of line anymore.
 I keep hearing loud noises
 coming from the palace...
 Something is weird!
 Maybe...
 It's a coup d'état?
 After giving the King 6/7 of my body,
 I've lost a lot of my power.
 The scales aren't scattering well.
 And I don't see any of Pitou's puppets.
 Does it mean the battle with the boy is so intense,
 Pitou cannot spare energy on puppets?
 The boy didn't look to be that strong.
 I cannot use my clones while
 I'm scattering my scales.
 But I need to hurry and kill the woman.
 Whatever it takes...
 This is my final chance!
 Deadline x To x Live
 Palm, take the four women still here with you.
 They didn't run away?
 No.
 Use duct tape to bind their
 hands and cover their eyes.
 If they see me, it'll take too long to explain.
 That's true... I understand.
 Why did we put them on the truck, anyway?
 A messenger?
 You just have to tell the King or the Royal Guard
 that the woman is in the underground warehouse.
 Let them know that we're looking to negotiate.
 Once that's done, you're free.
 It's probably a trap, right?
 That's what I'll tell the King.
 If I don't, it'll look unnatural, and he'll suspect me.
 Yeah.
 Wait... Just the fact that I'm doing the
 enemy's bidding may anger the King.
 I'm not gonna dig my own grave.
 Fine, I'll try it.
 Can you drive?
 Better than you.
 It's important that he carries out his mission.
 Perhaps I should keep an eye on him,
 even if it means losing Pouf...
 Palm.
 It's okay.
 Welfin,
 once this is over, you're free.
 Go and see Gyro.
 Don't get too cocky!
 I'll kill you!
 Don't you dare speak his name!
 You would never understand!
 I understand, Zaikahal.
 How...
 How do you know
 my former...
 I didn't tell anyone.
 I probably won't ever remember my former name,
 but we were buddies.
 Buddies?
 Before we were Ants.
 They're our enemies.
 Enemies of NGL.
 Am I wrong?
 Brovada has forgotten his past,
 but he was also one of us.
 Take him with you.
 Ikalgo...
 How do you know?
 What do you mean?
 You told me to go see Gyro.
 You'd only say that if you knew Gyro was alive.
 Yeah, that's true.
 But...
 I don't know that he's alive.
 I just can't believe otherwise.
 Since we all ""survived.""
 He couldn't have just been digested.
 Damn it... Damn it!
 Damn it!
 Are you sure about this, Pouf?
 Ten minutes have passed, and I don't
 see any sign of Pitou returning...
 Get out.
 Remove your bonds and use a truck to escape.
 Once you're outside, you'll understand
 the current situation.
 I hate to admit it...
 But Ikalgo's right.
 Killing Gyro wouldn't be enough to stop him.
 Which means they're the enemy.
 I owe him for giving me a wake-up call.
 I'll be his messenger!
 Stop!
 Youpi-dono?
 I already found a Royal Guard.
 Youpi-dono...
 I have a message that must be
 taken to the King immediately.
 The underground warehouse?
 Yes.
 And they're looking to exchange
 the woman for their allies that
 have been taken hostage?
 Yes.
 Please tell the King at once.
 Got it... I'm on it.
 Right...
 We're having a contest, so I
 don't need to tell the King.
 If Pouf was anticipating this, he's a smart one.
 You can go.
 Yes, sir.
 Once he's back, I need to tell Pouf.
 Still, what's Pitou doing right now?
 Chimera Ants are the enemy.
 Gyro's enemy...
 Our enemy!
 Youpi-dono!
 I have a question!
 What is it?
 Do you have any memories of your former life?
 Memories from before you
 became a Chimera Ant?
 No, of course not.
 I am the Royal Guard Youpi.
 I've never been anyone else.
 Don't ask me stupid questions!
 Youpi-dono...
 Hey! That's enough—
 If you attack me, I'll fight back.
 I have a few questions for you.
 You have five seconds to answer.
 Don't get too cocky, you little punk!
 Contest...
 Contest...
 Something is missing...
 Marshal
 Marshal
 Marshal
 Yes...
 I was
 battling someone.
 Someone
 that I have yet to defeat
 a single time...
 That took much longer than expected.
 By now, Pitou must have returned...
 I hope the King hasn't grown impatient.
 Where's Youpi?
 Where has Youpi gone?
 What's that?
 Youpi?
 I-It can't be...
 We're okay now...
 What do you mean, Palm?
 King! Meruem-sama!
 Youpi has been killed.
 There are still skilled enemies around!
 Where's Pitou?
 Oh, Pitou hasn't returned...
 Then...
 I can now begin, yes?
 W-Wait, Meruem-sama!
 The situation has changed...
 It's too dangerous! The contest is—
 The contest is off?
 That means I have won.
 Tell me everything you know.
 Is that acceptable?
 We're okay now?
 What do you mean, Palm?
 Killua deduced that she is special to the King.
 But the Royal Guard is divided...
 That is because
 Pitou tried to save and protect her,
 while Pouf tried to kill her.
 In other words,
 she is a double-edged sword for the King.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait...
 I find that hard to believe.
 It's impossible
 for the Royal Guard to bicker
 and defy the King's will!
 Is it?
 Then why are you and I here now?
 Wouldn't you say it's impossible for Soldier Ants
 to side with humans?
 Adding humans to the gene pool
 has led to many events that would be
 impossible for normal Chimera Ants.
 Can you be certain that I'm wrong?
 Sorry...
 My point is that
 the division among the Royal Guard
 may not necessarily contradict
 their loyalty to the King.
 There is a human that the
 King cares deeply about.
 ""We must protect that human.""
 ""We must kill that human.""
 Both reactions make sense.
 For now, I'll concede that point to you.
 Why does that mean we're okay now?
 Twenty minutes have passed
 since the initial wave of En.
 But the King hasn't killed or captured us yet.
 I don't get it...
 What's going on here?
 When the En was used, I was carrying this girl.
 If the King had noticed,
 he would have come straight to me.
 He didn't because I had
 concealed her within my hair.
 It's possible that he didn't realize
 I was carrying another person.
 Are you following me?
 It seems logical, so I can't argue that...
 But I still don't see your point.
 If she's covered up, the King
 can't find her with his En.
 Are you suggesting
 that we let Knuckle and Meleoron die,
 rather than make an exchange?
 Of course not...
 We'll offer to make an exchange.
 But we'll try to buy as much time as we can.
 To accomplish that, we must hide her in a place
 where the King cannot find her.
 Buy time? How long are we talking?
 Until the King dies.
 What is she talking about?
 Until the King dies?
 Sure, he has to die sometime...
 But if we knew when he'd die,
 we wouldn't have a problem!
 Why are we okay now?
 Give me a proper explanation!
 The King will die, and it will happen soon.
 Within the next few hours,
 the King will die!
 We need to go deeper...
 Yes, we must put her in a place
 where only we can find her.
 That should do it.
 All that's left is to negotiate,
 without going far enough to make the King snap.
 I know...
 What we're doing is cruel.
 We are no different from them.
 No...
 We are far worse!
 Pitou... Pitou...
 Where are you?
 Pitou!

 No...
 We are far worse.
 The rose was poisonous.
 The poison, which spread
 when the rose bloomed,
 was superior to similar toxins
 because it was immediately absorbed by
 those in the area unfortunate enough
 to survive the explosion.
 Rapid destruction of their organs would begin,
 and their bodies themselves
 would become poisons that continued to
 emit new poison, until the victim died.
 The amount of poison for a lethal dose and
 the amount of time until the subject died
 perfectly created a chain of poisoned victims.
 In other words,
 it was a demonic weapon
 more inhumane than any other.
 The Word x Is x That Someone
 Th-This is...
 What is happening to my body?
 Pouf.
 Is something the matter, Meruem-sama?
 Have you changed your mind?
 In that case, we must evacuate you at once.
 Your Majesty?
 Even when I can see right through him,
 he still refuses to divulge his secret.
 Very well.
 I only have to capture the remaining intruders.
 I am very curious about your secret now.
 You do not intend to change your
 mind about telling me, do you?
 I will keep my word, even if it costs me my life.
 Good.
 He's already using his final
 permissible En search!
 I can see
 everything.
 I see what has changed since
 the first time I used En.
 The footprints that were not there before.
 An abandoned vehicle.
 Youpi's corpse.
 A door that has been opened.
 And someone responding to my
 En who did not previously.
 Huh?!
 Was it you who killed Youpi?
 A-Absolutely not!
 I am a mere Squadron Leader!
 I would never have any reason to kill Youpi-dono!
 Youpi-dono
 was talking to me when he
 suddenly coughed up blood,
 became overcome with pain, and died.
 I swear that I'm not lying!
 I'm not lying...
 Yes, I did attack Youpi.
 But before he could answer my question...
 Before my black centipedes could even hatch...
 He died.
 I believe that he must have been hit
 by some sort of attack before encountering me.
 That's why I came here to
 investigate if any intruders
 are hidden in the crowd.
 The Royal Guard Pouf...
 He's going to be trouble.
 I'm pretty sure he has the
 ability to read my mind.
 Welfin is a serious threat.
 I have no idea what he might tell the King...
 Simply telling him to keep quiet
 would be too lenient.
 I should eliminate him immediately!
 I should accuse him of being a traitor,
 and execute him on the spot.
 In any case, I must get him away from the King.
 Meruem-sama, he is—
 I know what you want to say.
 I can now sense the emotions of
 any that my En has touched.
 I could feel his unbridled hostility toward me.
 In...
 Incredible...
 Once someone has been exposed to my En,
 I can see into their mind by simply looking.
 So it wasn't just Youpi's wings and attacks.
 The King also inherited my Spiritual Message...
 And he's made it infinitely more powerful.
 Your Majesty!
 The King is invincible...
 The King is unrivaled!
 And yet...
 Why?!
 Why is my heart
 filled with
 such unease?
 Now there is some fear mixed in,
 but there is no concealing
 your desire to kill me.
 I am interested to learn
 what drives your hatred of me.
 Speak.
 Lie, and you will regret it.
 This is no time to let emotion
 get the better of me!
 Tell me what you know.
 Meruem-sama!
 You must follow the proper order.
 He has deep ties to my secret.
 However, he does not realize this.
 If you continue questioning him,
 it is very likely that he will reveal
 part, or all, of my secret.
 When the King has such power, lies are futile.
 Then I must use the truth!
 I believe that you would not want your reward
 before winning the contest.
 I will keep my secret hidden using only truth!
 If you wish to continue our contest,
 I believe you should wait to question him.
 What is this guy talking about?
 Secret? What secret?
 Wait, what do I do now?
 How do I escape from this monster?
 Damn it!
 I didn't realize he was this powerful!
 I should have run away right off the bat.
 Temptation got the better of me!
 When I saw the giant Youpi
 shrunken down like some bug,
 and then he dropped dead,
 I actually had the delusion that I could be King...
 So I stayed...
 I was drunk on my delusion!
 I felt almighty, like some sheltered little kid.
 I felt alive.
 Yeah, I'm an idiot! I was drunk!
 Too many things happened simultaneously,
 and then I remembered Gyro.
 I panicked and got sentimental,
 and wanted to be a hero!
 I thought I could avenge Gyro.
 But Gyro isn't even dead...
 He's alive, for sure!
 I should have run,
 and teamed up with him again
 before seeking revenge!
 Damn it!
 It's that octopus's fault.
 He threw me off my game.
 He threw my emotions out of whack.
 He led me astray!
 Damn him! ""Messenger,"" my eye!
 I have to do something.
 He knows my intent is hostile.
 And I can't lie...
 He'll send my head flying before
 I can activate Missile Man!
 What tools do I have left?
 The message?
 Pouf's secret?
 The drive behind my hatred?
 Everything that I know?
 Will it be enough to save me? What do I say?
 The first...
 The first word I say is key.
 Just one word will decide
 whether I live or die.
 If I choose the wrong one, it's all over!
 This overwhelming pressure.
 This abnormal tension.
 Pouf, does that secret
 have any relationship to the hatred
 he feels toward me?
 This is the King...
 After interrupting me in the
 middle of my questioning,
 you gave me a direct order.
 I presume that you are prepared
 to accept the consequences.
 I want a sincere answer.
 This is...
 The King's new power meant that
 he could probe for the answer he sought
 without waiting for Pouf to speak.
 Despite the understanding that he
 had Pouf's unwavering loyalty,
 the murderous aura visibly
 emanating from the King
 indicated that Pouf would have no choice
 but to atone with his death if that answer
 was not what the King wanted.
 Loyalty and hostility
 were equally meaningless before the King.
 No one could stop him.
 Even then,
 I was already
 prepared to die.
 I will sacrifice myself
 to my own loyalty.
 There is nothing that I can say.
 Though the contest has yet to conclude.
 That is all there is to it...
 His incredible resolve and madness
 stopped the King.
 I am hungry.
 However...
 Welfin immediately understood...
 I am...
 I am going to be eaten!
 One second later...
 I'm dead!
 Upon learning his fate,
 Welfin instantly appeared
 to age one hundred years.
 I want to live.
 That was when his past rapidly
 flashed through his mind
 and then scattered, the fragments
 mingling with his present.
 One word...
 My first
 and last!
 Caught between the desire to live
 and unavoidable death...
 One word...
 The message for the King!
 One word!
 What Pouf discussed with Pitou!
 One word!
 Pouf's secret!
 One word!
 I...
 One word!
 ...won't die until I'm dead!
 As his brain cells began working
 harder than ever before,
 he made a choice that he never would
 have in normal circumstances.
 Komugi?
 This...
 This is...
 This is how deeply he values her!
 Pouf...
 This is your secret.
 Yes.
 He values her more than I feared.
 Punish me for my actions.
 No words are needed.
 We are one now.
 There will be no punishment.
 I never had a chance...
 Yes.
 Continue searching for Pitou.
 The two captured intruders
 may have information.
 Once you are done, release them.
 I have nothing else to ask them.
 All I can do is nod.
 Yes.
 The opened door...
 And footprints leading inside.
 The resolve of the two that I sensed with my En.
 All signs lead to one conclusion.
 Welfin...
 Y-Yes!
 Komugi is in the underground warehouse
 with the woman and the octopus.
 Your job was to deliver that information
 to me or the Royal Guard.
 H-How did you know that?
 I believe the octopus was the
 reason you accepted this job.
 There was a different reason
 why you did not complete it.
 Is that reason the cause of your hatred for me?
 So it is.
 Do not worry.
 Once you answer my question,
 you are free to go wherever you wish.
 You have my thanks.
 You helped me to remember
 something very important.
 They said that they're waiting in Bizeff's
 private courtyard, in Area D.
 Gyro is the only man I'll ever call King!
 You... All of you...
 Are enemies!
 Our enemies!

 I hope you can live as a human.

 This Person x And x This Moment
 It appears that only one of you is here,
 but I shall address this
 message to both of you.
 He knows exactly what we're doing.
 We won't be able to trick him.
 What I felt after coming into
 contact with your Nen
 was not anger, fear, or hatred.
 Only senses of duty and resolve.
 If you are fighting for the survival
 of humanity, your battle is over.
 You need further explanation?
 It seems you doubt what you've just heard.
 Then I shall repeat myself.
 You have won... The battle is over.
 The rest of what I have to

 The reason I am here is quite simple.
 I have one motive...
 I wish to see the human named Komugi.
 That is all I want.
 That is really all I want.
 I desire nothing else.
 After coming into contact with your Nen,
 I learned my current state and fate.
 And having learned my fate, I simply wish
 to spend my remaining time with Komugi.
 That is all I want.
 Was this...
 Was this a plan you devised after
 discovering my personality?
 No, I already know the answer...
 It's impossible.
 You expect me to believe you?
 You think I'll just accept that explanation?!
 An omnipotent King would
 never lie to himself in order
 to fool a lower being like me!
 After all the killing you have done,
 and soon will do...
 A creature like you...
 The King admits defeat? Cares for a human?
 Impossible! That's impossible!
 He's doing this because it is the truth!
 I believe it was only a slight change...
 Huh?
 Something, somewhere, changed ever so slightly.
 In my current state, I am not a god,
 but I...
 No...
 Perhaps, I only feel this way
 because everything has fallen into place.
 You should know I have very little time.
 I want you to tell me her location,
 so I do not have to search for her.
 What are you saying?!
 Stop this...
 Yes, I know where she is!
 Why don't you just torture it out of me?
 I know the answer.
 We both know that isn't an option.
 Your aura is as strong and beautiful
 as any I have ever beheld.
 Stop this!
 All I can do is to ask you to help me.
 Don't!
 I am part Ant now...
 I know very well how important
 you are to the race...
 Not that...
 Don't go to such lengths...
 You mustn't do that...
 I'll tell you.
 But on one condition.
 May I use my power
 to watch your final moments with her?
 If that is what it takes to be with Komugi,
 you certainly may.
 Sorry, Killua...
 I couldn't
 keep our promise...
 4-7-1, marshal...
 Wake up, Komugi.
 It's time to play.
 We have a shocking news update.
 The true purpose of the summoning
 of all Republic of East Gorteau
 citizens to the capital city
 was a plot by the Supreme
 Leader to massacre them.
 The body of Supreme Leader Diego
 was discovered under the rubble,
 suggesting that the victims were
 likely forced into mass suicide.
 But the second-in-command,
 Secretary Bizeff, is still missing,
 so some authorities believe a
 revolution is the greater likelihood.
 Meanwhile, there has also been trouble
 in the NGL region of the Mitene Union,
 as international peacekeepers
 have sent queries regarding refugees,
 and have received no response.
 There have been rumors of
 illicit dealings between
 East Gorteau and NGL,
 and the international community
 seeks to use this incident
 as an opportunity to conduct
 a more forceful investigation.
 Yeah, the boss did his duty.
 No, I wasn't there to see it.
 It still isn't clear yet.
 Yeah, we're waiting on Palm.
 Can we really trust her alone
 to verify the King's death?
 Plus, that person was captured and
 converted by the enemy, yes?
 Well, that's a question of professionalism.
 It would be professional
 to provide a complete report
 in the safest manner possible.
 But those are the professionals who spend
 all of their time sitting in fully-furnished offices.
 And when we field Hunters are told
 to trust a partner, we trust them.
 We're all professionals...
 But I'm the one out in the field!
 I'm not sitting in an office!
 The Vice Chairman's faction won't
 accept that argument.
 If they find out, you can expect
 to be questioned, at the least.
 Uh, I am Netero...
 Chairman, thank you for a job well done.
 May you rest in peace.
 The same day, a video was streamed
 online in which Netero announced
 his resignation as Chairman
 of the Hunter Association,
 and gave instructions for
 choosing his successor.
 However, major news stories in the
 government-run media overshadowed it,
 and only a few realized that
 the video was his will.
 Now, let us drink.
 Let us drink.
 Drink to the human race.
 In every age, there will be good
 humans and bad humans.
 Human life is too long
 to devote to reproduction,
 yet too short to devote to learning,
 in the helix of time.
 Perhaps that is why humans succumb
 to desire and seek release.
 Despite the fact that life is complete
 with the sun, the land, and poetry.
 Supreme Leader Diego (Real)
 In his 30th year of retirement,
 on a farm, in an unnamed country
 It's over...
 But it feels like we
 haven't played in ages...
 Playing in real life is completely different
 than playing in my dreams.
 Yes.
 I thought I felt someone kick
 me hard in the stomach.
 After that, a strange person kidnapped me...
 But you must have saved me, Supreme Leader.
 It wasn't me. It was my subordinates.
 I was wrong?!
 I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
 I was unworthy of their loyalty...
 When they stop by, I must thank them.
 I will relay your gratitude.
 I'll be seeing them soon...

 M-My name is Komugi...
 It is an honor to know you!
 I know.
 No...
 That isn't true.
 I knew nothing.
 I didn't understand what really mattered.
 Meruem-sama?
 No honorific is necessary.
 Don't make me repeat myself!
 No honorific is necessary!
 B-But, I could never do that!
 I would never dare address
 you without an honorific!
 Then if I beat you at Gungi, you will
 address me without the honorific.
 I understand.
 Do I die after I've addressed
 you without the honorific?
 Ah, that's right.
 There is no need for you to die.
 I am not the same person I was before.
 You should be prepared to lose.
 Yes!
 What do you want if you win?
 I would like another match!
 It was a foolish question.
 Let's begin, then.
 1-5-1, marshal.
 9-9-1, marshal.
 7-9-1, pawn.
 2-3-1, pawn.
 2-7-2, musketeer.
 Could it be?
 7-1-2, fortress.
 This is...
 Marshal
 ...kokoriko?
 Komugi, do you mean to mock me?
 No.
 I want a sincere answer.
 I will not allow you to fool around.
 Yes, I have never fooled around
 while playing Gungi.
 Very well.
 If you lose, you will die.
 Yes.
 Certain Death
 Is she saying this will not
 mean her certain death?
 She had a number of other options.
 But all would only serve to lengthen the
 game without increasing her chances.
 If she thinks she has a chance to win...
 9-2-1, new lieutenant general.
 I want to see
 where this goes!
 4-6-2, spy.
 Th-This is...
 She
 has found a way out.
 That night, I realized something.
 Quiet!
 Let me think.
 Here.
 This is the only way to go!
 I should be able to checkmate her!
 When she's forced closer to my position,
 my advantage grows with each move.
 But if she slows down and allows
 me a turn to attack,
 she can't stop the knight
 and lieutenant general!
 2-6-1, knight!
 I reversed her new move!
 What now?
 What is wrong?
 Why do you cry?
 Am I...
 Am I allowed
 to be so happy?
 Can...
 Can so many
 wonderful things happen to someone like me?
 I suppose I must tell you the truth.
 I...
 I have been poisoned,
 and I have little time.
 Meruem-sama...
 Komugi, I wanted...
 to spend my final moments
 playing against you.
 But this poison is contagious.
 If you stay near me too long, you will also...
 She reversed my reversal?
 Meruem-sama...
 Right now, I am very happy.
 I may not be worthy,
 but please allow me to join you.
 I see...
 I...
 I believe
 that I was born to be here today.
 ...was born for this moment.
 Spy               Marshal
 4-4-1, pawn.
 6-5-1, knight.
 2-7-2, new spy.
 Komugi, are you still there?
 Yes, I sure am.
 I'm not going anywhere.
 4-5-1, lieutenant general.
 That's checkmate.
 Komugi, are you still here?
 Yes, yes... Right here.
 Let's play another match.
 The loser goes first.
 Komugi...
 Yes, yes? What is it?
 It appears I never defeated
 you a single time.
 What are you saying?
 We've just gotten started!
 Yes...
 1-5-1, marshal.
 9-5-1, marshal.
 Komugi, are you still here?
 Yes, of course.
 It's your turn, Meruem-sama.
 I'm a little tired...
 I need to take a short nap.
 Will
 you hold my hand?
 Komugi?
 Komugi, are you there?
 I can hear you.
 I understand.
 Like this?
 I'll wake up shortly.
 Will you stay by my side until I wake?
 I've never left your side.
 I'll always be here.
 Komugi...
 Yes, yes? What is it?
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 Will you call me...
 Yes?
 ...by my name one last time?
 Good night,
 Meruem...
 I'll be joining you
 soon.
 Next time: Homecoming x And x True Name.

 Welcome home, Reina-chan.

136,"Homecoming x And x True Name
 With the death of King Meruem,
 the battle between Chimera Ants
 and humans was over.
 Republic of Rokario
 NGL Autonomous Region
 Hass Republic
 Republic of East Gorteau    Republic of West Gorteau
 The Republic of East Gorteau and
 the NGL were tentatively placed
 under control of international peacekeepers,
 and the nations essentially ceased to exist.
 Between the two former nations,
 five million survivors were declared refugees.
 The Mitene Union's three remaining members
 divided East Gorteau's riches and agreed
 to jointly govern the former nation's territory.
 As for the NGL,
 there was a proposal to give all open land
 permanent designation as nature reserves,
 to prevent future incidents.
 And the international community concurred.
 It was agreed that the nature reserves would be
 under the Hunter Association's jurisdiction.
 Are you sure about this?
 Yeah, I'm gonna live here.
 The name ""Gyro"" doesn't mean anything to me.
 But this place feels very familiar.
 I'm guessing that I was an NGL resident
 that didn't work for Gyro...
 Well, I won't force you to come, then.
 This is probably safer than other countries now.
 Exactly.
 One look at me, and the peacekeepers
 would freeze on the spot.
 Is that
 why she's staying?
 No, in her case...
 She seems more like you guys.
 What do you mean?
 Hey! Aren't you done?
 We'll leave you behind!
 Damn, she's annoying... Give me a minute!
 Well, people like me who barely
 remember our previous lives
 can tell that people like you and Hina,
 who have their memories, are different.
 There's something in your eyes.
 Or it's how you look into the distance.
 Somehow, I can tell at once.
 ""This guy remembers his past.""
 And I can tell that
 she remembers her past.
 Hina said she'll never talk to us...
 But I don't think it's that she won't talk.
 It's that she can't talk.
 She's probably just a kid.
 Welfin!
 Zip it! I get the idea!
 See ya.
 We probably won't see each
 other again, so take care.
 Yeah.
 Try not to die until you're dead.
 The hell is that?
 Gyro's way of saying goodbye.
 It's one of my favorite phrases.
 Did you just remember something?
 No... I just kinda like the phrase.
 Oh.
 So life is what you make of it, huh?
 Later.
 Yeah.
 Well, let's get going.
 Okay! It's time to go look for Gyro-sama!
 Seriously, you have no shame.
 Not so long ago, it was
 ""Hagya-sama"" this, ""Leol-sama"" that.
 Who's that?
 Huh?
 No point in thinking about the dead.
 I have to move forward!
 Straight ahead!
 Still... Are you sure we can
 make it through the port?
 Yeah, this is a government vehicle,
 so once I show my card, they'll let us pass.
 Soon, I'll be a resident of Meteor City...
 How far I've fallen.
 Don't be so negative about it.
 Just be patient.
 I'm sure that Gyro's also headed there.
 It's possible that
 he's already gathered all the sympathizers
 and tools we'll need to build our own nation.
 Which means...
 In no time, we'll be back on top!
 Yay!
 You're so optimistic, I can only envy you.
 Optimistic?
 You've got that right.
 I've already died twice...
 But I'm still alive!
 Nothing scares me now.
 I'm ready for anything!
 Plus,
 I'm the one who stopped the King.
 H-Hey...
 Yeah, I'm a class-A political criminal.
 Might as well enjoy whatever is left of my life.
 Yeah, that's the spirit.
 Humans are alive until they're dead!
 What? You're stating the obvious!
 Quiet!
 Welfin, Hina, and Bizeff head to
 Meteor City, in search of Gyro.
 Is that the village?
 Hey...
 Don't worry.
 I'm with you.
 Monsters!
 Well, that's to be expected.
 Hey!
 People of NGL!
 I need someone who can communicate
 in a peaceful and reasonable manner!
 I'm not here to harm anyone!
 I just have a question to ask!
 Hey! You can speak?
 Who are you?
 Uh...
 This will probably be hard to believe,
 but will you hear me out?
 You're the only people I can turn to!
 Reina?
 How did...
 you know?
 Reina...
 Reina...
 Reina!
 How did you know?
 Of course I knew...
 I'm your mother! I'm your mother, Reina!
 Welcome home.
 I'm so glad you're back.
 Brother tried to protect me!
 He told the monster to go away,
 and told me to run... He kept me safe!
 But I was too scared to move!
 I'm sorry!
 It's okay... I'm sorry.
 You and Kurt did your best.
 I'm sorry I wasn't there with you.
 I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe...
 Welcome home, Reina-chan.
 You must be hungry.
 Let's eat together.
 Hey...
 Why don't you join us?
 No... I'll pass.
 Don't say that.
 You saved Reina-chan.
 Please let us feed you.
 That isn't what I was doing...
 See ya.
 Damn...
 I've returned the favor, okay?
 Damn that stupid octopus!
 He never should've let me live!
 Thank you...
 Let's eat.
 Let's eat
 together.
 Huh?
 What's going on?
 What... What's wrong?
 Reina and Brovada return home.
 Hello? Is this Colt?
 It's me.
 The politicians have turned this
 into an international crisis.
 The Ants are no longer involved.
 No longer involved?
 Is that actually possible?
 That's what politicians do.
 You'll be classified as a new Magical Beast.
 Magical Beast...
 Well, if they label you as a good
 Magical Beast, you'll be fine.
 Any changes on your side?
 Actually, something has been bothering me.
 Something bothering you?
 Yeah, it's Reina.
 No! You're wrong!
 She keeps saying her name isn't Reina.
 What is it, then?
 I'm not Reina!
 My name
 is Kite!
 Gon!
 Killua!
 Doctor...
 How's Gon?
 He's still in critical condition.
 I wouldn't recommend sending
 him to a specialist
 until he can be taken off life support.
 I've never seen or heard of anything like this.
 How could this happen overnight
 to a twelve-year-old boy?
 I understand.
 We'll bring the specialist here.
 He's a hero who's earned special treatment.
 I will cover all the expenses.
 If necessary, we may have to
 rebuild this entire hospital.
 In any case,
 we cannot let Gon die.
 In the end,
 you did everything by yourself...
 I want that one myself!
 I get it.
 Kite saved your life, and he
 has no connection to me.
 But... Still...
 I wanted you to ask for my
 help in defeating Pitou!
 Let's go.
 Did you say that to me as a teammate?
 Or as a friend?
 I know...
 This is just a tantrum.
 It's the same as always.
 You run ahead,
 while I clean up after you.
 The same as always...
 I'll clean up your mess!
 But this time, I won't let it slide.
 You have to apologize.
 I'm going to
 heal you up!
 So you have to apologize!
 Killua...
 We're assembling a team of
 medical specialists to save Gon.
 I must head back, so I can use
 Hide and Seek to transport
 equipment and people.
 Will you come with me?
 No, I won't.
 That's true...
 It's important to stay with Gon
 and talk to him, as well.
 I'm going to save Gon.
 You go get those doctors.
 They'll still be needed...
 While I'm gone.
 Killua?
 I'm the one who'll save Gon!
 Uh, I am Netero...
 I'm resigning as chairman, so you're on your own.
 The next chairman will be selected by election.
 I am setting the condition that
 all Hunters must vote.
 If voter turnout is under 95%,
 the results will be invalid.
 I ask that the Zodiacs handle the details,
 such as schedule and polling method.
 I'd say the difficulty for this mission is D-rank.
 I'm counting on you all.
 Take care.
 In response to Netero's message,
 the Zodiacs, the Hunter Association's leaders,
 assembled at headquarters that day.
 Next time: Debate x Among x Zodiacs.
 I won't say anything until I've seen your face.
 I'm going to heal you up,
 so you have to apologize!

 Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!
 My guess is that when I was a
 baby, I came here with Ging.
 He was probably trying to tell me this:
 If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,
 I have to get strong enough
 to clear the game...
 Well? What will you do once you find Ging?
 Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!

 Damn, bad roll.
 Shut up!
 You should be grateful, you idiot!
 An ant?
 Are you hurt?
 Is that Ging?
 That isn't Ging...
 Hey...
 What was that about?
 First you push us down, then you fire at us!
 Enough fooling around!
 Fooling around?
 I was being dead serious.
 If I hadn't opened fire,
 you would have been attacked.
 By what?!
 The ant you shot?
 Ow!
 What is this?
 Idiot!
 That's no ordinary ant.
 It's a Chimera Ant.
 A Chimera Ant?
 An aggressive, carnivorous insect,
 currently under class-1 quarantine.
 From time to time, they even attack humans.
 You were standing right in front of their nest.
 Had I not fired,
 a Chimera Ant army would
 have consumed you by now.
 I feel like this has happened before...
 Don't worry, it's not serious.
 Apply this.
 It's an antibiotic.
 What? That's it?
 Let's go nuts, man!
 Shut up... Go away.
 You should leave, as well.
 Damn...
 Because of this interruption,
 I'll need to start over.
 But the nest was destroyed.
 Man, forced to take another life...
 Ah!
 Man, forced to take another life...
 Are you...
 Are you the one
 who saved me back then?
 Back then?
 On Whale Island, after I stumbled into
 the territory of a Foxbear with its cub.
 Whale Island?
 That time, too,
 you had to kill, in order to protect me.
 Oh, yes. I remember now.
 I never expected to run into you again here.
 You've grown, Gon.
 How do you know my name?
 I heard it from your dad,
 Ging-san.
 Old man, you know Ging?
 Old...
 Yeah, my name is Kite.
 Ging-san was my master.
 Oh, so you're also pro Hunters?
 Yep. Are you one too, Kite-san?
 Call me Kite.
 It's awkward being addressed
 formally by my master's son.
 Okay.
 Then, you're one too, Kite?
 Yeah, Ging-san was the one who
 made me a top-class Hunter.
 He was my teacher and benefactor.
 If I hadn't met Ging-san,
 I'd have died long ago, in the alley of a slum.
 Wait up!
 Damned brat!
 He swiped the bread that
 I'd managed to find...
 He isn't escaping today.
 My bread!
 Bastard,
 you won't get away today!
 Ow!
 What is this?
 What are you doing?
 Stop it...
 You live with these guys?
 That sounds fun.
 That was how you met Ging?
 Yeah...
 Ging-san said that good Hunters
 are well-liked by animals.
 He said I had potential, so I got interested.
 And you became his student?
 I had to force him to teach me.
 He hated dealing with any kind of hassle...
 So I was never his student officially.
 But I was a stubborn one...
 I kept bugging him.
 Eventually, I started to develop my Nen,
 and he began teaching me to hunt.
 As a result, I was able to pass the
 Hunter Exam with little difficulty.
 But before Ging-san was satisfied,
 I had to clear another hurdle.
 Can you guess what it was?
 I think I might know.
 Oh?
 No, I definitely know.
 This is what Ging would have said...
 ""Try to catch me.""
 Exactly. You're right.
 I knew it! I figured that was it!
 But as far as I knew, he was
 the world's greatest Hunter.
 It was going to be the most difficult hunt ever.
 There were no clues or leads to begin from.
 And I didn't hear word of a single sighting.
 He'd managed to completely erase
 his existence from this world.
 Like a super-powered form of Zetsu?
 So...
 So what happened in the end?
 I was struggling, and grasping for a single clue,
 so I went to his home.
 To Whale Island.
 That was when I met you, Gon.
 But back then, I didn't realize
 that you were Ging-san's son.
 I didn't learn that until I'd found Ging-san
 and told him about what had
 happened on Whale Island.
 That was my kid... His name is Gon.
 Thanks for hitting him.
 It's common sense to avoid
 Foxbear territory when they're raising young.
 Ging-san wasn't surprised
 that I went to Whale Island,
 or that I met you there.
 It was almost as though he'd expected it.
 Looking back,
 it may be that everything's gone
 according to Ging-san's plans.
 Are you saying he set all this up?
 Well, I can't prove it.
 You might be right.
 Razor was waiting for me.
 And Dwun and List.
 Razor? Dwun?
 Yeah, in a game called Greed Island...
 It's a long story.
 In the game, a guy named Razor was
 waiting for me, at Ging's request.
 My son will come here one day.
 When that happens, give him a good beating.
 Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?
 Don't get too cocky.
 He is my son.
 Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.
 Dwun and List were among Ging's ten friends
 who helped him create Greed Island.
 Oh, Razor was also one of them...
 Anyway, those three were waiting for me.
 When I learned that, I realized something.
 If Ging planned for me to go to Greed
 Island and meet his friends,
 meeting Bisky and the others may have
 been another part of his plan.
 In that case,
 it's possible that Ging also planned
 that you'd meet Kite here.
 Huh?
 Oh, that's right!
 You must have been to Greed Island before.
 Me?
 Yeah, did you register under the name ""Nigg""?
 Nigg?
 No, I don't recall that name.
 Wait...
 I do remember Ging-san taking
 me inside a game...
 I knew it!
 Greed Island...
 Yes, I believe that was its title.
 But I can't remember if I used an alias.
 That must be it...
 Ging must have had you use the name Nigg.
 Damn! He tricked me!
 You were so sure you'd meet him, huh?
 Are you sure this was the right decision,
 Ging?
 Can you make it so that using
 Magnetic Force will send Gon to me,
 while using Accompany will send him to Kite?
 I can...
 Why do you want me to do that?
 If he uses Magnetic Force to see me on
 his own, I'm willing to meet with him.
 But I can't meet him if he's so gutless
 that he has to bring friends.
 Why would bringing friends mean he's gutless?
 I don't understand.
 Never mind... Just do it!
 You'd probably just be
 embarrassed if he brought a crowd.
 Shut up! Just do it!
 He's so weird...
 Shy and stubborn.
 I feel sorry for Gon-kun.
 I understand.
 So the game Greed Island was
 created to train you boys.
 Only Gon, really.
 I just tagged along for the ride.
 That may have been part of Ging's plan, too.
 Even me?
 Nah, that's impossible.
 However,
 it appears that our meeting
 here wasn't coincidence.
 Yeah, I agree.
 There must be a deeper meaning to this.
 Meaning?
 Razor waited inside the
 game to make you stronger,
 so one would think Ging must
 have some role for Kite to play.
 A role...
 Your final test was finding Ging, right?
 Yeah.
 That sounds like a daunting task.
 The best Hunters in this world
 are masters of not only hunting,
 but concealing themselves as well.
 Yet you were able to find him.
 Oh...
 Yeah, that's true.
 Once you cleared your final test,
 Ging must have decided you were
 worthy of handling this.
 Handling this? Handling what?
 Handling what? Basically...
 Thanks for hitting him.
 Say, Gon...
 Want me to tell you Ging-san's
 current whereabouts?
 No, I'll find him on my own.
 A good response.
 Anyway, tell me about Ging.
 Tell me everything you know!
 How to help two-headed wolves breed?
 Ging is involved in that stuff?
 Sure, Ging-san is involved with a
 wide range of Hunter activities.
 He's never formally applied
 because he doesn't want
 to expend the energy, but he's as
 qualified as a Triple Star Hunter.
 Triple Star?
 Stars are awarded to Hunters who
 perform extraordinary tasks.
 Those responsible for
 historical discoveries or global
 achievements receive three stars.
 There are fewer than ten of
 these Hunters in the world.
 The title ""Triple Star Hunter""
 is reserved for the very best.
 So Ging is as good as the best!
 Kite...
 A Hunter who earned Ging's respect.
 Ging-san is also famous
 for discovering the Lurka Ruins
 and the Kongo gold vein.
 Oh, I've heard of the Lurka Ruins!
 Kite, student of Ging...
 While his meeting
 with Gon and Killua signaled the
 beginning of a new adventure...
 On the Yorbian continent, in the
 southernmost of the Balsa Islands,
 a prologue to unparalleled fear
 was quietly but steadily unfolding.
 Not enough.
 These creatures are not enough,
 no matter how many I eat.
 But I cannot move...
 Stay calm.
 Focus on recovering my energy.
 I must heal before I can take the next step.
 I have a duty to fulfill...

 Unease x And x Sighting
 After using Accompany,
 Gon and Killua were transported
 to Ging's student, Kite.
 After Gon remembered having
 met Kite years before,
 he felt that Ging intended
 for this meeting to occur,
 and his interest in Kite grew.
 Hey, what kind of work do you do, Kite?
 Biological surveying.
 I focus on discovering and
 researching new species.
 Oh, have you heard of the Camp Tiger?
 Camp Tiger?
 They can use fire.
 They use branches that have been
 ignited by lightning as live kindle.
 Other than certain Magical
 Beasts that walk on two legs,
 they're the first of their kind:
 animals that eat their meat cooked, not raw.
 Wow, they're really cooking it.
 They really are using fire!
 Hey, what else is there?
 Oh, yeah...
 You said the thing that attacked
 me was a Chimera Ant?
 Yes, a Chimera Ant.
 Under a class-1 quarantine.
 Normally, no one would be allowed
 near such a dangerous insect.
 Did you discover them?
 No, I specialize in larger creatures.
 But currently, I'm investigating these insects.
 Something has been bothering me...
 But it appears that now, I'll have
 to move to a different location.
 I must make a call, but I'm not
 getting any reception here.
 A call?
 I'm working with others.
 Seven of us are working as a team.
 I guess I must wait for their arrival.
 Once they're here, I'll introduce you.
 They're amateurs, but they're still skilled Hunters.
 Oh?
 Ah, speak of the devil.
 Kite, who are these kids?
 My friends.
 They dropped by for a visit on their travels.
 Oh, it's a pleasure to meet
 you all the way out here.
 I'm Spinner Clow.
 Call me Spin!
 Nice to meet you.
 I'm Gon Freecss.
 Nice to meet you, Spin.
 Freecss...
 Wait, is this...
 Yes, Ging-san's son.
 Really?!
 And you? Not you, too?
 No, not me.
 My name is Killua Zoldyck.
 Zoldyck...
 Um, forgive me if I'm wrong, but are you
 part of the famous family of assassins?
 Yeah, but I quit.
 Additionally, they are both pro Hunters.
 So you should show some respect.
 Wow!
 Man, that was a shock!
 We've been conducting biological
 surveys with Kite for three years,
 but this is the most incredible
 organism we've ever seen!
 Yeah, no kidding...
 I don't think we finished our introductions.
 I'm Monta Yuras.
 But call me Mon.
 Nice to meet you, Mon.
 I'm Stick Dinner.
 I handle the cooking.
 Know why?
 Because my name is Dinner.
 Nice meeting you.
 My name is Banana Kavaro.
 Good to meet you.
 We have two others on our team.
 Where are Podungo and Lin?
 They're both headed toward
 the area of the sighting.
 They always move so fast.
 Oh, and you were right, Kite...
 This looks just like the claw
 of a Chimera Ant queen.
 We ran some computer analyses,
 and the result was a 99% match.
 Can I see it?
 Sure.
 This is a Chimera Ant claw?
 It's as big as a human finger.
 Does that mean there are huge ants?
 We don't know.
 Maybe one mutated and grew really big?
 That's possible, though it may also belong
 to a completely different species.
 Regardless, we just don't know right now.
 That's why we're investigating.
 It all started with the wonkiest little thing...
 His name was Won!
 He was a Kakin official.
 What's Kakin?
 Right here.
 It's this wild land, in the middle
 of the Azian continent.
 We had just completed a biological
 survey they had requested when...
 Magnificent.
 You've completed two hundred years'
 worth of work for this agency...
 To be honest, I regret that I am
 unable to pay you a bonus.
 Don't say that, Won-san.
 We enjoyed ourselves.
 In lieu of that,
 I'll be sure to recommend you
 to other friendly nations.
 We appreciate it.
 Oh, that's right!
 I'm going to ramble a bit.
 I believe part of a very strange species was
 brought to the Southern Piece auction...
 There's suspicion that it's from
 an unidentified organism,
 so the seller couldn't list it in the catalog,
 but since they'd have to donate it
 to a government agency otherwise,
 they hoped a licensed Hunter would
 buy it from them for a high price.
 Here you are.
 Well, Lin?
 Th-This clearly belongs to an
 unidentified organism, yes.
 F-From what I can see,
 it resembles an insect's leg...
 B-But no known insects have l-legs this large.
 And the claw exhibits traits
 not found among insects...
 A leg typically has two claws, but this has six.
 It almost looks as though the tarsi
 evolved into something like fingers?
 Yes, and this part is spiny,
 so it could be the tibia.
 If we take a sample and study
 it further, we'll learn more.
 Could you give us a small part?
 Since Won-san referred you
 to us, we cannot refuse.
 Let's look into this, then.
 We'll send you any results, once we have them.
 Appreciated.
 Chimera Ant...
 Where did Lin and Podungo go?
 Somewhere south of Yorknew City.
 The person who found the insect leg
 apparently lives in a city by the ocean.
 Sorry you won't be able to catch your breath,
 but we should hurry after them.
 Hey, can we come with you?
 Hmm?
 Sure.
 Yes!
 Glad to have you.
 Having two pro Hunters with us is reassuring.
 And this is Ging-san's son and
 one of the Zoldyck family!
 Oh, sorry...
 It's no big deal.
 Anyway, you kids are already pros at your age?
 We weren't born with the talent...
 Talent, talent... Guess I have a
 talent for saying ""talent,"" huh?
 In this brief period of time,
 they've become friends.
 Good Hunters are well-liked by animals.
 And also blessed with good friends.
 Gon might be the real deal...
 He'll find you soon, Ging-san.
 Not enough... Not enough...
 I need more, bigger food.
 It's been days...
 No, it's been months since it last rained here.
 The weather is unusual this year.
 It's possible that this is affecting
 the wildlife in some way.
 So the insect with the large leg
 could have been a mutation
 influenced by those conditions.
 But why would it have grown larger?
 In order to survive, right?
 If it's bigger, it'd have a better
 chance of securing food.
 But that would mean it'd need more, as well.
 Being larger doesn't always aid survival.
 I believe that this is
 related to the Chimera Ant's unique
 nature, not to the environment.
 I agree.
 Because they reproduce in a way
 not found in any other organism.
 What do you mean?
 They reproduce through a special
 process known as phagogenesis.
 Phagogenesis?
 What's that?
 Phagogenesis
 When a Chimera Ant queen eats other organisms,
 she is able to pass traits on
 from those organisms to the next generation.
 And she can also eat multiple species
 to pass on a mix of genes to her offspring.
 With each feeding, she lays one to five eggs.
 The first generation of births has
 no reproductive capability,
 so they become worker or soldier ants.
 They work in service to the queen
 and her eventual successors.
 Those successors are the king and
 queen of the next generation.
 The queen is thus always looking to
 consume the genes of strong organisms,
 so she can pass them to her offspring.
 And she may consume any species she
 particularly likes to extinction.
 To extinction?!
 Yes, her voracious appetite can drive her
 to consume her own weight many
 times over, in a single day.
 That's why Chimera Ants are
 under a class-1 quarantine.
 So if she sets her eyes on you, you're finished?
 Judging from the size of that claw,
 her length is at least two meters.
 That thing could devour a human in no time.
 Yes, you are correct.
 Stay back! Go away!
 B-Big Brother...
 Reina, stay close to me.
 Take that!
 It's okay now.
 Thank you!
 You can count on your big brother.
 I'll always keep you safe!
 Yeah!
 Okay, let's go home.
 Hey, my brother was amazing!
 There was a big snake, but he was like,
 ""Stay back! Go away!""
 Whack!
 Come now, don't wave your spoon around.
 It's bad manners.
 But that's what he did.
 Yes, yes. I know.
 That was very brave.
 If a big snake showed up,
 your mother might be too scared to move.
 You're truly a young man, Kurt.
 Yeah, I guess.
 You're already nine...
 And a reliable big brother.
 You must continue to look after Reina.
 I'm counting on you, Kurt.
 I'm counting on you, Brother.
 Yeah, you can count on me!
 I'll keep you both safe forever!
 This area is about to hatch.
 Soldiers, hear me!
 My duty is to give birth to the King.
 In order to give birth to a strong king,
 I require large quantities of highly nutritious food.
 Search out the best food you can find!
 This area will also hatch soon.
 I require a large nest in
 which to birth a strong king.
 I also need time to rest, free from concerns
 of outside disturbances, during the pregnancy.
 In order to give birth to a strong
 king, I need strong soldiers.
 Are you okay?
 Uh-huh, thank you...
 Hey, Brother...
 When I grow up, I'm gonna marry you.
 Sure.
 Let's wake up early tomorrow
 and go fishing at the river.
 Yeah.
 We can cook some fish to surprise Mom.
 Uh-huh, I can't wait.
 This is enough fish for a feast.
 Yep.
 B-Big Brother...
 Big Brother!
 Reina, it's okay.
 I'll...
 Your big brother will protect you!
 I promised Mom!
 I'll keep you safe!
 Go away...
 Go away!
 This is delicious,
 and very nutritious...
 The ultimate food.
 I need more of this species.
 They're the ones I mentioned on
 the phone, Gon and Killua.
 Oh, I'm Lin Koshi.
 N-Nice to meet you.
 My name's Podungo Lapoy.
 Glad to have you on board.
 Glad to be here, Lin-san, Podungo-san.
 Hey.
 Let's get down to business.
 Where was the leg discovered?
 On the beach over there.
 A-According to the locals,
 it washed up on sh-shore.
 There's a forest right behind us...
 It'll be difficult to find the
 Chimera Ant if it ran in there.
 We can't be certain that it's still alive.
 We don't even know if it ended up
 on the same island its leg drifted to.
 Let's find out, then.
 Here, remember this scent.
 I'll help, too!
 Huh?
 His nose is as sharp as a dog's.
 He can't find anything...
 The scent may have disappeared.
 It was raining.
 I couldn't find anything, either.
 That means the Chimera Ant isn't here.
 It may have washed ashore elsewhere.
 In which direction do the currents flow here?
 It's complicated...
 The direction is reversed
 between day and night.
 And it also changes with the seasons.
 I've even heard it's different on certain days.
 So it'll be tough to pinpoint a location...
 It's too early to give up.
 Let's split up and search.
 You're right.
 No luck...
 Continuing to search blindly is pointless.
 Let's return to Yorknew City.
 We may be able to find a new lead.
 Her length is at least two meters.
 That thing could devour a human in no time.
 A voracious appetite...
 Phagogenesis.
 Your Majesty...
 Oh, you can speak?
 So that I may fully receive,
 understand, and execute your orders.
 That pleases me.
 I assign you to be a squadron leader.
 I am most grateful.
 I already have your mission.
 Lead all the soldiers here on a mission
 to capture my food...
 Capture more of those highly
 nutritious organisms for me.
 At once!
 A Chimera Ant has been born with human genes.
 Kite's worst fears have been realized.

 Very x Rapid x Reproduction
 Class-1 quarantined insects
 and insatiable carnivores: Chimera Ants.
 Once they've evolved beyond
 two meters in length,
 humans no longer stand a chance.
 Hey, what's that?
 M-M-Monsters!
 Listen carefully!
 Target the fully grown ones.
 They will provide the most nutrition.
 Now go!
 A Chimera Ant queen
 moves repeatedly until she
 finds a place she likes.
 As she does, she births more and more
 soldier ants to build her own army.
 Once she's chosen a location,
 she births a large number of carpenter ants,
 which construct her castle with incredible speed.
 From then on, the queen remains
 within the castle until death.
 So if a Queen grew to two meters tall
 and were to set her sights on humans,
 there should be entire villages
 or towns of missing people.
 I don't see anything...
 I just checked the past six months,
 and the largest group only numbered ten.
 Say, can we look up missing people individually?
 Don't be ridiculous.
 You know how many hundreds of thousands
 of people go missing worldwide?
 We should be able to see which areas
 have the highest concentrations.
 No good... The data's two years old.
 Perhaps we should start by checking for sightings.
 If someone saw a two-meter insect,
 they'd make a big fuss.
 We tried that, of course.
 But we couldn't find anything.
 Maybe we're getting worked up over nothing...
 Yeah.
 Bring up the tidal data from
 the day the arm was found.
 The arm was discovered here...
 Now go back ten days.
 Locate any currents that may have carried
 the arm to that location in that time.
 What do you mean?
 It's possible that the arm
 was severed after the Chimera Ant made landfall.
 That makes sense.
 It could have come from any of the Balsa Islands...
 Including the Mitene Union.
 The Mitene Union...
 Oh, where the NGL Autonomous Region is.
 Yes, as well as East Gorteau.
 There's no getting information
 out of those two countries.
 What's this NGL?
 An acronym, standing for Neo-Green Life.
 It's a country founded by people who wanted to
 live in nature, away from machine civilization.
 Here.
 Mitene Union:
 NGL Autonomous Region
 Republic of Rokario
 Hass Republic
 Republic of West Gorteau
 Republic of East Gorteau
 They primarily communicate by letter.
 Primary means of transportation is by horse.
 Anyone knowingly bringing technology into
 the country is subject to execution.
 In '87,
 a three-man TV crew was caught trying
 to enter the country to get a story.
 One was executed, and the
 other two remain in prison.
 Of its 2.17 million population,
 99% belong to the Neo-Green Life Party,
 with the rest being support volunteers.
 If the Chimera Ant washed ashore there,
 how would the NGL citizenry react?
 They probably wouldn't do anything.
 When a deadly epidemic spread throughout
 the area, they let nature run its course,
 refusing to admit international doctors.
 And even if they tried to contact the outside,
 it would be too late by the time word arrived.
 If that arm belonged to the Chimera Ant queen,
 she may have already begun to build her nest.
 A contest?
 Yeah...
 Between you and me.
 Let's see who can bring the Queen more humans.
 I challenge you!
 Hmph.
 What?
 You're running away?
 Hey, accept my challenge!
 Accept?
 Are you issuing an order?
 Why should I follow an order from you?
 I can only follow the Queen's orders.
 You're just scared of losing.
 My squadron is comprised of elite soldiers.
 I can beat any squadron in this castle!
 Oh, I know...
 I should get the other squadron leaders in on this.
 If we all compete, we'll capture more prey.
 More prey?
 I see...
 I agree with that idea.
 If we gather more prey, the Queen will be pleased.
 Okay, that settles it.
 However, I believe that the
 prey's quality also matters.
 We must ensure that the Queen
 eats highly nutritious humans.
 That guy's such a stiff...
 That's what makes him endearing.
 He is dedicated and loyal.
 I presume the human he was created
 from was also quite earnest.
 Hey, wait!
 Weren't you supposed to get some rest?
 I'll bring her back.
 Don't bother, it won't help.
 But she goes to the forest every morning,
 and she spends the whole day searching.
 Right, she'll probably collapse soon...
 But she can't stop looking.
 That's what it means to be a parent.
 How many days has it been since
 Kurt-kun and Reina-chan vanished?
 It's like spirits whisked them away.
 Big bugs...
 Huh?
 We haven't raided this area yet.
 Mom!
 It must be them...
 Those monsters must have stolen your children!
 Excellent.
 This should suffice to please the Queen.
 Wh-What's happening?
 Exterminate the insects quickly.
 That's Gyro's order.
 Gyro? What's that?
 Our king's name!
 Damn!
 I bought tickets to the Mitene Union.
 But to reach NGL, we have to
 take an airship to the neighboring
 Republic of Rokario,
 and travel by land from there.
 It ""ant"" gonna be easy to get into
 a country of such nasty rumors.
 Just kidding.
 Nasty rumors?
 What do you mean?
 Have you heard of D²?
 D²?
 It's an ingestible drug that's propagating rapidly
 throughout urban areas worldwide.
 It's derived from the bila tree,
 native to the Mitene Union.
 And they claim
 that over 80% of the world's
 bila trees are located in NGL.
 So the nasty rumors are saying that the
 drug is being manufactured in NGL?
 They're only rumors.
 No one has been able to publicly prove it.
 After all, the country's locked down tight.
 When people try to get in to
 investigate, they're executed.
 Executed...
 He wasn't executed?
 No, if he'd been captured trying
 to uncover NGL's secrets,
 he'd have probably been executed
 like that TV crewman.
 But this reporter was wearing a wire,
 from which we intercepted the final message.
 When the message was played...
 M-Monsters...
 Giant bugs!
 Giant bugs?
 What do you think?
 That isn't enough information to be sure...
 As a Magical Beast Hunter,
 I'll have to see for myself.
 Then that settles it.
 I'll get three tickets.
 Make it four.
 Ponzu...
 I'm coming with you.
 You can't.
 This is too dangerous,
 and you don't have a professional license yet.
 And we're talking about NGL...
 That's why I should come.
 You aren't allowed to bring technology into NGL.
 If they discover you with cell phones
 or wireless communicators,
 you'll be arrested right away.
 So if there's any trouble, you'll need me...
 Or rather, you'll need them.
 They can carry a letter anywhere.
 I get it.
 They'll certainly come in handy.
 It may be a bit late to ask,
 but are you sure you want to come?
 Of course!
 You weren't kidding about the ""late"" part.
 We have no idea what the situation is inside NGL.
 There may very well be a swarm
 of giant Chimera Ants already,
 hunting humans down.
 If that turns out to be the case,
 my priority will be saving them.
 So I may not be able to help you.
 You must be able to protect yourselves.
 If you want to come, that's the requirement.
 Okay, got it.
 We'll be fine.
 And if I'm the one who's in danger,
 you should escape without me.
 Got it?
 A pretty good haul.
 But it's not even half the size of
 what my squadron delivered...
 My focus was quality.
 And I wasn't competing against you.
 Whatever.
 Anyway, did you hear?
 That turtle guy ran into human resistance.
 Resistance?
 Hmm,
 those were probably guns.
 Guns?
 Put simply, it's a barrel that launches
 metal projectiles called bullets
 using the explosive force of gunpowder.
 It's one of the most commonly
 used human weapons.
 No idea what you're talking about...
 If you want the details, read books.
 Books are wonderful.
 You can learn about how these
 human creatures think,
 behave, and function as a society.
 Can you answer my question, then?
 Do humans have armies too?
 Armies?
 Yes, that was an army.
 They belong to a military body
 led by an authoritative figure,
 much like ourselves!
 Ah, I have another question.
 They mentioned something about a name.
 A name?
 I can't blame you for not understanding.
 Because it's a human idea
 we do not make use of.
 Put simply...
 So it seems there are humans
 capable of more than running and crying.
 I don't know why that should surprise you.
 Given how different you and I are,
 it's only natural that individual humans
 would have unique traits as well.
 After all, their blood flows through us.
 Assemble, squadron leaders!
 Assemble, squadron leaders!
 The Queen summons us.
 Assemble, squadron leaders!
 Do you get a headache when
 the Queen calls to us?
 Yeah, my ears start ringing.
 It's too bad the Queen can't talk like we do.
 I shall now begin preparations
 for the King's birth.
 Every day, provide me with fifty humans.
 Yes, Majesty!
 Your Majesty, may I ask a question?
 Permitted. Speak.
 Among the humans are soldiers like ourselves,
 with weapons to use against us.
 We must fortify our defenses,
 in preparation for any potential attack.
 I have a few ideas...
 Would you care to hear them?
 I shall let you decide your course.
 I must focus entirely on my son.
 Yes, and one more thing...
 Would you allow us to have names?
 What is a name?
 It's like a code that can be
 used to identify each of us.
 Very well, do as you like.
 I am truly grateful!
 How peculiar.
 They speak their minds and
 request to use these names.
 While bettering the race, they compete for glory,
 leading to a stronger sense of individuality.
 I suppose I am also peculiar to
 find this change fascinating.
 Perhaps I, too, have traces
 of human blood within me.
 Regardless, I feel quite confident now.
 I can see you already, as though
 recalling a memory from my past.
 My King...
 You shall stand atop this world!
 Names... Quite amusing.
 The King's three Royal Guards.
 I shall name you myself.
 What did you just decide?
 Remember what Kite said before we left?
 That we should escape without
 him if he's in danger.
 Yeah, I don't think it was a choice...
 Yeah.
 That's why neither of us said anything,
 but I've been thinking.
 Is it possible for Kite, who earned Ging's respect,
 to be in that much danger?
 You said that Ging had a reason for
 bringing Kite and me together...
 Yeah.
 You're probably right.
 I don't know the reason,
 but I can't give up halfway,
 no matter what's going on.
 Otherwise, I'll disappoint Ging.
 Of course, I could never forgive myself, either.
 So I won't run away.
 That's what I've decided.
 Man,
 you had this totally serious expression,
 so I was expecting something big.
 But it's just business as usual.
 Huh? I thought about this a lot.
 I even ran a bunch of mental simulations...
 Think all you want, but you'll still be Gon.
 If someone said you should abandon them,
 you'd never do it.
 You make it sound like I wasted
 my time considering it.
 Then what about you?
 I'm a spontaneous guy, so I'd think
 about it when the time comes.
 You mean you might run away?
 Depends.
 I can't say until it actually happens.
 Say for instance...
 I can't tell you what I'd do in
 a hypothetical situation.
 I don't decide until it's time.
 The airship carrying the group
 heads for the Mitene Union,
 still unaware of the cruel fate
 that lies in wait for them...
 Next time: No x Good x NGL.

 Kite's group has arrived in the Mitene Union.
 NGL Autonomous Region        Republic of Rokario
 Now, they travel from the Republic of Rokario
 to the neighboring NGL Autonomous Region.
 NGL, huh?
 They believe living naturally is always better.
 They may be weird for living there,
 but you guys are weird for coming to visit, too.
 No idea what's going on,
 but I've already driven in about
 ten similar groups today alone.
 Ten groups?!
 Yeah.
 Then it sounds like we're
 among the last to arrive.
 They're probably other pro Hunter teams.
 All looking for the giant insects?
 Yeah, those veterans are good.
 Somehow, they've managed
 to obtain this information.
 But are there really bugs
 large enough to attack humans?
 It defies common sense,
 but that voice they heard over the transmitter...
 M-Monsters...
 Giant bugs!
 It could be some other kind of organism.
 NGL is one big nature reserve,
 so it's said to be inhabited by many organisms
 that haven't been reported in academic circles.
 It wouldn't be strange if there are
 insects that attack humans.
 Even if there aren't any giant bugs,
 this trip will be worth it if we can confirm the
 existence of any unidentified organisms.
 As a new Magical Beast Hunter,
 I need to produce results.
 Now that I'm here, I have
 to accomplish something.
 According to the scouts that
 went out first thing this morning,
 a new human village has been discovered
 in sector MA18, in the southwest.
 There are twelve houses,
 with anywhere from twenty to sixty residents.
 Hey, that's pretty big.
 Guess there are still a few large villages left.
 I thought we'd already cleaned out that area.
 Then I will add this village to our
 list of targets for the day.
 Colt, could you make the trip?
 Roger.
 What's this, Peggy?
 You aren't sending me?
 Cheetu, I need you to go northwest,
 as originally planned.
 Zazan, you accompany him.
 There aren't any large villages
 left in the northwest.
 Even if there were, there probably
 aren't any strong, young humans.
 It's more fun when I get to chase them around.
 Cheetu!
 We do not hunt for amusement.
 We serve the Queen.
 We need only capture the
 requested number of humans.
 I know that, Colt.
 We'll get the job done.
 Right, Zazan?
 I'll fulfill the quota.
 But I don't need you telling
 me how to hunt my prey.
 I'll do things my own way.
 It's fun to hunt humans when
 they're running around.
 What did you say?
 Well, there you go.
 Let's go, Zazan.
 Colt, don't get too worked up.
 You'll have an easier time
 if you learn to relax.
 They dare do things their own way?
 At this rate, their squadrons will fall apart!
 While the use of names
 is convenient for leading the troops,
 we don't want to encourage too much individuality.
 Their behavior could lead to
 a breakdown in command.
 We must take steps.
 I agree that something must be done.
 Meleoron and Yunju have yet to
 show themselves at a war council.
 Meleoron!
 Stop hiding, and show yourself!
 Just to be clear,
 it isn't my fault Yunju is absent.
 You were hiding because you
 thought you'd be blamed?
 You're supposed to be a squadron leader.
 Where is Yunju? Why is he not here?
 See? I'm the one getting yelled at.
 That's why I didn't want to come out.
 It's always my fault.
 You're just as guilty for hiding the truth.
 And further...
 I'll talk!
 It isn't like I wanted to cover for him or anything.
 He's the one who ran off on
 his own to hunt humans.
 What? Toward which sector?
 Was a new village discovered?
 That's not it!
 You remember the humans who fought back?
 The ones who were armed with guns.
 Yunju was
 all worked up about making them his pets.
 Come on! What are you doing?
 I accidentally stepped on you.
 You're supposed to entertain us more!
 That's right!
 Run for your lives!
 Until you're dead.
 This is the border with NGL.
 Those two huge trees serve as
 the checkpoint and embassy.
 What's out here, in the middle of nowhere?
 These people are all so weird.
 Stay alert.
 The Ants are a concern, but the NGL is
 more than a nature-loving organization.
 Got it.
 What brings you here?
 We're on a hunt.
 A quarantined organism may
 have invaded this country.
 If you are pro Hunters,
 then we cannot deny you entry.
 Follow me.
 You're using computers and machines.
 This place isn't within NGL's borders.
 This area is used for foreign relations
 and information exchange.
 Are there any facilities similar
 to this within the country?
 No, not a single one.
 No machines of any kind are allowed inside NGL.
 Naturally, visitors are also not allowed
 to bring any inside.
 Which means that you'll need
 to remove all metallic,
 petroleum, glass, or other
 such goods on your person.
 D-Does that include my glasses?
 Yes.
 If your clothes, belts, shoes, or
 underwear contain any plastic,
 chemicals, or metal, you must remove them.
 That isn't funny.
 You're telling us to strip naked?
 Don't worry.
 There is natural clothing for sale upstairs.
 Also, if there are any bolts inside
 your body, dental implants,
 gold, silver, or silicon enhancements
 that cannot be removed,
 you will not be allowed to enter.
 Shop
 Only the five of us are left?
 I want you to stand by in the closest town.
 We'll return here within two
 weeks and contact you.
 Got it.
 The checkpoint is over there.
 There will be a physical exam and interview,
 as well as metal, x-ray,
 and ultrasound scanning.
 The security is rather strict.
 Some people have smuggled in guns by
 hiding the parts inside their bodies.
 It's common for people to hide cameras
 or cell phones in their rectums.
 Some people even trained animals
 to bring them laptops once they were inside.
 All of you are clean.
 Thank you for your patience.
 Please pass through.
 Welcome to NGL.
 Okay, let's begin the hunt.
 Horse Rental

 Any sightings of giant insects?
 I haven't heard anything.
 Even if there were any such creatures,
 the citizens in this country wouldn't
 make much of a fuss.
 If we are attacked and killed by animals,
 that is simply nature taking its course.
 Anyway, we should follow the
 coast and check the villages.
 If we go through all of them
 and nothing turns up,
 it probably isn't in this country.
 That's assuming those guys
 were telling the truth.
 They're still following us,
 aren't they?
 Yeah...
 They claim to be here
 in case we encounter unknown tribes and
 require interpreters or intermediaries.
 But they're obviously here to watch us.
 Well, I never expected the people
 here to be of any help.
 My gut
 tells me that it's here.
 Don't move.
 If you die, it won't be my fault.
 A-A mere animal shouldn't order
 a superior human around!
 Mere animal? Superior human?
 I don't understand...
 How are you and I different?
 Shut up!
 Good grief...
 Didn't your parents ever teach you
 to answer a question when you're asked?
 There's no hope for you, old-timer.
 Try harder in your next life.
 Now you've done it.
 If you kill him, we aren't able to store him.
 I can make meatballs to serve
 to the Queen within the day.
 People like him irritate me.
 They don't know their place.
 I prefer to see them running around in fear.
 Yesterday, you shot one in
 the back when they ran.
 If you'd let me handle this, I could secure
 our prey in a smarter fashion.
 When you said, ""Don't move,""
 that was meant for me, right?
 Giving your squadron leader an order, huh?
 Don't get too cocky.
 I'm forgiving, so I'll let it slide.
 If you enjoy killing so much, you should
 volunteer for the feeding squad.
 No hope...
 Damn that Yunju.
 Shut up!
 If you don't shut up, I'll eat you right here!
 Rammot!
 What are you doing?
 What am I doing?
 I'm transporting the food.
 Isn't that obvious?
 Be more selective with your prey!
 How often do I have to repeat myself?
 That human won't serve any purpose.
 And we've already met our quota for the day.
 You're wasting your time.
 Then I'll eat it!
 What?
 It'll be eaten sooner or later, anyway.
 This is an order, Rammot.
 Damn.
 Too many soldiers trying to do things their way.
 Huh?
 I don't see any problem.
 I enjoy what I do.
 You want to take this one?
 I guess it's dead, so you can't.
 Which squadron are you from?
 Oh, Zazan...
 That nasty woman.
 You have my sympathy.
 You could join Yunju's team.
 I hear that they're allowed to
 kill any humans they want.
 If you take this as a gift,
 they'll probably let you join on the spot.
 What is this?
 It's terrible...
 Who did this?
 A gun?
 People are fighting with guns!
 Who could it be?
 Guns aren't allowed in NGL!
 They're members of the NGL
 underground that manufactures DÂ².
 Huh?
 I don't think these wounds
 were inflicted by humans.
 Does that mean...
 I can't be certain yet...
 But if the monster we seek
 was responsible for this,
 we won't be able to handle it
 with our current members.
 Th-There they are!
 Monsters!
 Ponzu! Balda! Pekuba!
 Run on my signal.
 Got it?
 Rainbow!
 Seven Spectrum Array
 Red Arrow
 Red Arrow!
 Now!
 No hope.
 Over here!
 Are you okay?
 Yes...
 Anyway, we should contact
 the other pro Hunters.
 Can you handle that, Ponzu?
 Got it.
 What? That's it?
 No, there are more.
 There sure are!
 I can smell living humans!
 What do we do, Zaikahal?
 As the Chimera Ants continue their rampage,
 they have cornered the country's shadowy ruler.
 A storm brews in NGL.
 And Gon's group is heading straight for it.
 Next time: Evil x and x Terrible.
 Gon, what's wrong?
 Do you have a fever?
 What? A crick in your back?
 Terrible...

80,"What do we do, Zaikahal?
 Evil x and x Terrible
 His name is Gyro.
 And he is the NGL's don in the shadows.
 Gyro spent his first twelve years
 in a construction camp.
 By the time he said his first word,
 he'd learned to lay bricks and mix concrete.
 His father forced him to slave away...
 until Gyro finally killed him and fled.
 His father, who raised Gyro
 alone, was a silent man.
 When his father returned from work,
 he drank cheap liquor by himself
 until he went to bed.
 He very rarely talked to Gyro,
 who was on the upper bunk.
 Thus, Gyro barely knew
 how to speak before the age of seven.
 When Gyro returned from work,
 he was not permitted to leave his bed,
 except when visiting the restroom.
 He was allowed to relieve himself twice
 a day, and only before 9 PM.
 The bed's rotting wood creaked loudly
 whenever he turned in his sleep.
 His father hated that sound.
 After his father once severely
 beat him because of that noise,
 Gyro learned to sleep without any motion.
 He also learned to control his bladder at night,
 keeping an empty liquor bottle
 for when he couldn't hold it.
 ""Don't make trouble for others.""
 That was the one lesson his
 silent father taught him.
 From a young age, Gyro did
 his best to adhere to it,
 learning from his mistakes.
 Since his father had never
 bought him even one toy,
 this lesson was his one and
 only gift from his father.
 Within his small world,
 his father was essentially God.
 And no matter how cruel his father could be,
 Gyro continued to idolize him,
 believing that his father needed him.
 This belief stemmed from two facts...
 When Gyro was five,
 a terrible fever nearly killed him.
 All night, his father stayed up,
 replacing his towels with fresh ones.
 And the other reason was...
 that his father had never
 once ordered him to leave.
 Gyro was proud of these two facts.
 ""Idiot...
 He hasn't kicked you out
 because you bring in money!""
 Though he had previously kept that
 possibility locked away deep in his mind,
 Gyro snapped when the older youth
 insensitively brought it to light.
 Regretting that he'd revealed his secret,
 Gyro was furious with himself.
 His pride wounded, rage overcame
 him, and he attacked the youth.
 The youth had always mocked the timid boy,
 so when the boy fought back,
 he went mad with anger,
 to the point where not even
 knocking him out would satisfy him.
 He stomped on the boy's face,
 spat on him, and uttered the finishing blow:
 ""When you were sick, a neighbor took care of you!
 Your old man was drinking by himself as always.
 You were delirious, so you wouldn't know this.
 But that night, the neighbor had
 a fight with your old man.
 He asked your dad what he'd do if his kid died.
 Let me tell you what your old man said.
 It wouldn't matter.
 I don't care if he dies.
 You hear that?""
 As Gyro listened to the youth,
 he witnessed something inconceivable.
 His father looked him in the eye,
 paid him no attention, and then left.
 That was when Gyro finally understood.
 The universe doesn't give a damn about me.
 My father doesn't care if I live or die.
 In other words, my life has no meaning.
 If I live, I'll bring in money.
 If I die, I'll just free up a little space. That's all.
 My father told me not to
 make trouble for others
 so as to avoid any inconvenience for himself.
 It was never a lesson to help his son.
 It was fully for his own benefit.
 In that lesson, ""others"" meant my father.
 No...
 It meant ""humans.""
 Don't make trouble for humans.
 I must not be human...
 Eventually, the boy stood up,
 grabbing a nearby hammer.
 Nine years later, Gyro founded the NGL.
 Nine years after that, NGL became
 a nation, with him as its king.
 Gyro desired to ruin life for the entire world.
 The drug D² was merely the first step.
 Yunju!
 You handed those humans over to Colt so easily.
 I didn't feel like fighting.
 Either way, the food will reach the Queen.
 I just want to enjoy the hunt.
 Gyro...
 Damn, I should have just eaten him!
 Listen up!
 I'm taking over this factory!
 From today on, this is my fortress!
 This is awesome!
 This is bad.
 These creatures are too dangerous!
 Look!
 What...
 What is happening in this place?
 What? More dead soldiers found?
 Yeah, three of Zazan's were discovered.
 Plus, one of mine is missing...
 Its communication has been cut
 off, and it hasn't returned.
 Yunju's team dealt with the
 humans holding guns.
 Does this mean there are other
 humans who are resisting us?
 Sounds that way...
 But the dead soldiers were killed
 by something that wasn't a gun.
 Something?
 What could it have been?
 How would I know?
 Probably some new weapon we haven't seen.
 Where are the corpses?
 Peggy's examining them above.
 This one was killed by a gun.
 I'm sure since bullets are still inside the body.
 But I'm not sure about the others.
 The skull was punctured.
 Yes, but not by a gun.
 And I had difficulty understanding
 the soldiers' explanation of the events...
 As it is, the foot soldiers' communications
 are simplistic and just to the point.
 They said one human mimicked firing
 a gun, and no projectile emerged,
 but something pierced the
 soldier's skulls and they fell, dead.
 Can't some soldiers both see
 and feel what's happening?
 You're correct.
 Those soldiers said that they
 felt a projectile being fired.
 So they possess abilities that we do not...
 These humans could prove tougher
 opponents than anticipated.
 If humans have this power, once we
 inherit their genes, we also will.
 We only lack the trait.
 You don't understand...
 The humans' strength lies
 in their ability to learn.
 If they learn that the Queen
 is where we're vulnerable,
 they'll do whatever it takes to kill her.
 Hmm?
 You're the one who doesn't understand!
 That just means we need to do
 whatever it takes to keep her safe.
 Am I wrong?
 No, you're correct...
 That's right.
 I will protect her...
 I will protect Reina!
 Reina?
 Who's Reina?
 Uh, you're the one who said that name!
 I did?
 I didn't say anything.
 You must be hearing things.
 Anyway,
 the problem is that humans
 possess multiple weapons
 capable of defeating our foot soldiers.
 What should we do?
 Use their weapons against them.
 Give them a taste of their own medicine.
 Only soldiers of our rank have the capacity
 to manipulate complex weaponry.
 But the humans don't know that.
 They must be very frightened.
 I understand...
 You're a better strategist than I am.
 Reina?
 It didn't work...
 No one received the message.
 That means all the other Hunters I was
 in contact with have been taken out.
 Oh...
 We should leave.
 Those creatures are too much for us to handle.
 We need to leave NGL and tell
 the world what's happening...
 So that an extermination force can be formed.
 Whatever... Let's just run for it!
 Or we'll all be—
 I-It's here!
 Run!
 More will be coming!
 Hold on, now...
 I said to capture the humans alive.
 We're supposed to deliver
 them to the Queen fresh.
 A-A human face...
 What is that thing?!
 Fire...
 Open fire!
 Orange Arrow
 He grabbed my Orange Arrow,
 fastest of my Rainbow Arrows, with ease.
 Huh? This is clearly visible.
 The grunts couldn't see this?
 So the life energy
 that surrounds your body is
 what fuels this weapon?
 You will make a magnificent
 meal for the Queen...
 Balda!
 O-Oh, no!
 I took a bite without thinking...
 Zazan-sama will be angry again!
 You bastard!
 O-One moment...
 My hands are full.
 Take this!
 As always, you're a disgrace in battle.
 Zazan-sama...
 Why don't you just drop what's in your hands?
 Oh!
 You're right.
 We're going back.
 Hmm?
 Since we've obtained some excellent food.
 He probably has the nutritional value
 of a thousand normal humans.
 Well done, Pike.
 Zazan-sama!
 I am most grateful for your praise...
 You honor me!
 Don't forget the food.
 Oh, yes...
 I can't save him myself...
 I have to call for help!
 There's still... There's still time!
 Even if they take him, they
 won't eat him immediately...
 Please...
 Find a Hunter with a strong aura!
 I must hurry back to the border!
 Other Hunters should be there—
 So much fun...
 Hunting is so much fun!
 Help!!
 Help!!
 Chimera Ant Nest
 Rocky Area
 Notify the Hunter Association!!
 It'll be dangerous.
 But could you accompany me?
 Of course.
 We're pros.
 Miss interpreter...
 Sorry, but we're in a hurry.
 Yes.
 The horses can move a bit faster.
 They won't be fast enough.
 I want you two to return to
 the border, find the others,
 and get word to the Association.
 These creatures are dangerous.
 Got it.
 Be careful, Kite.
 Right.
 If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind.
 Right back at you.
 All ready to go!
 Let's go.
 This is a bullet casing.
 Nothing mechanical is allowed here, right?
 So the underground rulers of NGL
 were manufacturing guns in addition to drugs.
 But judging by this...
 It wasn't done by a human.
 Most likely, it was a Chimera Ant.
 If the Chimera Ants are using guns...
 I hate to consider the possibility,
 but it's possible that NGL's underground rulers
 have already been fed to the queen...
 What will happen if Chimera Ants
 are born with their genes?
 NGL and Chimera Ants...
 The worst combination imaginable.
 This could create an unprecedented biohazard.
 The situation has taken a sudden
 turn for the absolute worst.
 Next time: The x Fight x Begins.

 The x Fight x Begins
 The Chimera Ants continue their
 rampage throughout NGL.
 And they've finally struck against the don
 who ruled this country from the shadows.
 It's safe to assume that the Chimera Ants
 have assumed control of NGL's interior.
 The question is if we can reach their nest
 before the Queen births the King.
 More!
 More!
 I need much more.
 I need more food of high
 nutritional value for my child.
 Over a hundred a day?
 Yes, the Queen has requested
 more food, to aid the King's growth.
 We've been providing fifty a day.
 Just when we'd managed
 to assemble enough soldiers to ease the job...
 If the Queen commands,
 we will double or triple our quota.
 We should increase our ranks...
 No.
 Increasing them would be simple, but it
 would disturb the chain of command.
 We must start by instilling more discipline.
 We'll increase our ranks afterwards.
 First, we must eliminate sedition in all—
 Don't make me laugh!
 That isn't going to be necessary.
 The rare human I captured has the
 nutritional value of a thousand normal ones.
 One with the value of a thousand?
 What are you talking about?
 You didn't know?
 I'm saying that some unique humans
 are overflowing with life energy.
 They're hard to find, which is why they're rare.
 Rare?
 These special humans each have the
 nutritional value of a thousand normal ones?
 That's right.
 Impossible!
 No such human could—
 They do exist...
 I saw and fought one.
 And then, I accidentally took a bite!
 Pike!
 The one you took a bite out of wasn't rare.
 Oh, yeah.
 You're right.
 Don't spout nonsense!
 Your words were also nonsense, Zazan-sama.
 I spoke nonsense? When?
 You weren't the one who
 captured the rare human.
 I did.
 Remember how you praised me
 for the wonderful job I did?
 I'm the one who disabled him!
 But I'm the one who held him in place—
 Enough.
 Make yourself scarce.
 F-For...
 Forgive me!
 Was that story true?
 Wh-Why, if it isn't Bihorn-sama...
 Yes, there really was a rare human.
 Not that!
 Did you really take a bite?
 No, I took a bite of the normal
 human, not of the rare—
 It doesn't matter if it was rare or not.
 Consuming the Queen's food
 is not permitted.
 I'll never do it again,
 so please spare me just this once, Bihorn-sama!
 Hold it! Come back here!
 Bihorn.
 Have you ever seen a rare human?
 No, I've only heard about them from Zazan.
 Zazan,
 could you provide more detail
 about this rare human?
 Sure.
 Arrows of light...
 I understand.
 That explains the hole in the skull of that grunt.
 Yes, that must be it.
 One mystery has been solved.
 While the arrows are invisible to foot soldiers,
 an officer like Pike can see them.
 See them and stop them.
 In other words, officers can capture them.
 Yes, like I did.
 That one was clearly different from
 the other humans we've captured.
 Its whole body appeared to
 be shining with life energy.
 That's how I knew
 that it would have the nutritional
 value of over a thousand humans.
 More than ten days' worth in one human?
 If that's true, we're saved.
 It'd be far easier than carrying
 a hundred humans around each day.
 If we find one on the first day,
 we can rest the next nine.
 Fool!
 They're rare because they're hard to find!
 What? Again?
 Understood.
 Is something wrong?
 Rammot is acting without my permission again.
 Damn!
 Why am I stuck eating horses?
 Damn...
 This is all Colt's fault.
 I want to eat humans!
 First, I have to deal with Rammot.
 Otherwise, it sets a bad example.
 What is this presence?
 Could it be?
 No one's here.
 Say...
 Something smells.
 Coming from over there.
 It's like a morning sacrifice.
 A ritual practiced by birds
 called bull-headed shrikes.
 They impale their prey on sharp
 objects, such as branches.
 Hey!
 Wha?
 Wh-What is that?
 They're capable of concealing their presence?
 Trash.
 Those are mine!
 Ow!
 This guy is strong.
 Fighting him won't be easy.
 Gon... Killua...
 You two must deal with him yourselves.
 That is a Chimera Ant soldier.
 We will encounter many more like him.
 I won't be able to help you during combat.
 If you can't defeat it, you'll have to leave.
 You'll just be in my way.
 Weren't you listening, Kite?
 We are also pros!
 Don't treat us like kids!
 What trick is this?
 Suddenly, they feel far stronger.
 Time to test it!

 Thunderbolt!

 Rock...
 Paper...

 Bastards!
 I'm gonna eat you!
 I will! Remember this!
 Our attacks...
 They didn't work.
 That guy's smart.
 He let his soldier do the fighting,
 so he could learn our abilities.
 Are you coming?
 There's no need to feel down.
 Your attacks weren't that bad.
 You just need experience now.
 If you wish to become stronger,
 this is a perfect opportunity.
 But if you aren't prepared, you won't
 be able to endure the ordeal.
 Whether we win or lose,
 hell lies ahead of us.
 We're coming.
 Yeah.
 That hurts...
 Damn...
 Don't lay a finger on them.
 I'm gonna get my revenge.
 I'll kill them...
 I'll eat them all!
 I'm willing to let you kill them.
 But you may not eat them.
 Bodies brimming with so much life
 energy provide the finest nutrition.
 They must be fed to the Queen.
 No way! Killing them won't be enough!
 I have to tear them to shreds,
 fill my belly with them...
 Crap on their skulls, and crush them!
 And even still...
 That still may not be enough to quell my fury!
 I won't be satisfied with just killing them!
 Don't get above yourself.
 This is an order.
 You would defy your leader's command?
 It isn't just Yunju's team.
 The other teams do it all the time.
 Cheetu and Hagya's teams
 do whatever they want.
 Their leaders enjoy the hunt!
 Is that true?
 Yeah!
 They chase humans, kill them,
 then leave the dead bodies there.
 None of the other squadrons just haul
 bodies back like industrious little drones,
 my dear leader Colt.
 I'll transfer to a different squad if
 that's what it takes to kill them.
 Damn, it hurts!
 A reason?
 Because it's fun, of course.
 It's good that humans know how to speak.
 That way, we know what
 they think as they die.
 I enjoy seeing the fear on their faces.
 Yep, it's great!
 Once you've tried it, you can never go back.
 Do you feel the same way, Cheetu?
 You're wrong about one thing...
 Hagya's and my teams are meeting our quota.
 We use our free time to enjoy the hunt.
 However...
 You shouldn't waste the Queen's
 precious food for sport.
 Precious food?
 Don't make me laugh.
 There are more of them than she'll ever need.
 They're trash!
 I'm just taking out the trash.
 Got a problem with that?
 Not at all!
 Do you know about the rare humans?
 Rare humans?
 Oh...
 The ones that are overflowing with life energy?
 I haven't seen one yet.
 If you do, capture it alive and bring it back.
 Fine.
 I'll give the rare ones to the Queen.
 Let that Rammot guy know, so he calms down.
 I'll take that as a promise.
 Fool. You think I'd keep that promise?
 Let's find a rare one and eat it.
 Let's eat!
 How's Rammot doing?
 Tonight will be critical.
 But his anger and stamina
 should see him through it.
 Still, our army seems to have
 too much personality.
 Having multiple perspectives helps,
 but too many are self-centered.
 We're meeting our quota, so there's
 nothing to worry about.
 You're one to talk.
 Are you counting the humans you capture?
 Hmm... Kind of.
 That doesn't count.
 Perhaps we should have everyone
 assemble to discuss this.
 No, we operate at different times now.
 Assembling everyone is impossible.
 I'll talk to each leader and devise a solution.
 What about the Queen?
 She's busy nourishing the King.
 We can't distract her.
 I'll handle this.
 Sounds tough.
 Don't ruin your health.
 If you're honestly concerned,
 try to control yourself.
 This is ugly...
 The stench alone would guide us to the corpses.
 Look at this.
 So this is the hidden side of NGL.
 I suppose so.

 overtaken by the Chimera Ants
 further intensifies the chill in the air.

 Kite x And x Slots
 Kite, Gon, and Killua have advanced
 deep within NGL, in search
 of the Chimera Ant nest,
 and have arrived at a cliff
 with peculiar openings.
 This is the Chimera Ant nest?
 No.
 They don't make their nests in holes.
 They use mud and feces to build them.
 Let's go.
 You'll understand once we're inside.
 There's no telling when or
 from where they will attack.
 Be on your guard.
 Yeah, got it.
 That other Chimera Ant
 completely concealed his presence.
 Yeah.
 Let's go.
 Is this place...
 Yes, it is NGL's hidden side.
 A drug factory.
 Exactly.
 This factory produces the ingestible drug D²,
 which is spreading throughout the mainland.
 There are probably nearby bila trees,
 which produce its main ingredient.
 Ironic given their claims as preservationists.
 They're making more than drugs.
 Look.
 It's the same as the others.
 I assume that only the NGL leaders
 know the truth of this place.
 The other members
 joined because they honestly loved nature.
 So this facility is the center
 of NGL's underground.
 If it's empty...
 Then Chimera Ants have wiped
 out the NGL underground.
 And a bunch of amateurs with guns
 won't suffice to deal with them.
 What about their boss?
 He either escaped or was eaten.
 Either way, it's bad news.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 Shh!
 A few are around.
 They're slowly approaching
 through the middle tunnel.
 There are more in the left and right tunnels.
 En...
 How far away can you search?
 Everything within a forty-five meter radius.
 F-Forty-five meters?
 Depending on physical and mental condition,
 I can increase that by a few meters.
 Here they come.
 Keep it down, you two.
 Who are you guys?
 How dare you intrude on my turf?
 Help... Please help us!
 Stop talking, Spot!
 You're just a damned dog!
 Oops, didn't mean to do that.
 Oh, well.
 I'm getting bored with these guys.
 Guess I'll get rid of Rover, too.
 When you beg like that,
 I just want to kill you more.
 Stop!
 Kite...
 Don't move carelessly.
 There's more than one enemy.
 They want you to rush over.
 Bye-bye.
 H-Hel—
 Don't look away.
 If they shoot a projectile your way,
 you won't be able to see it.
 I've got it.
 You three will be my new dogs.
 Chimera Ants have always been aggressive,
 but it seems consuming malicious humans
 has made them even more evil.
 Huh? What do you mean?
 Phagogenesis.
 If we don't deal with them here,
 many more will die!
 Capture them!
 I'll take the one in back.
 You boys will have to deal
 with the two rushing us.
 Right!
 Got it.
 Do not hesitate.
 You must fight to kill.
 Bring it!
 Ha, take this.

 That was close.
 You have more power than I expected.
 These guys are really tough.
 They have the hard shells of insects,
 combined with human agility...
 What's on your mind now?
 He's right.
 I can't hesitate!
 First comes rock...
 What?
 Little boy, do you want your new
 name to be Spot or Rover?
 Don't hesitate to kill.
 You'll be roving around the land of the
 dead in no time, so I'll call you Rover!
 Been a while since I flipped my switch on.
 Snake Awakens
 Damn you!
 Curse you!
 Take this!
 Fool!
 This is the poisonous one!
 Well?
 How does it feel as the poison
 spreads through your body?
 Does it feel good?
 Very effective.
 Once I drug him enough,
 we'll have a human dog.
 Are you done over there?
 Oh, not yet?
 How...
 My body is immune to poison.
 Ah, I see.
 If you behave, I'll kill you fast.
 Oh, well...
 It just means that I was weaker.
 She let that cheap act fool her.
 What is this power flowing from his body?
 Any closer, and I'll suffer considerable damage.
 But...
 What's wrong?
 Are you getting scared?
 If I don't attack, Yunju will kill me!
 The source of his power
 is his fist!
 He's preparing to launch an attack many...
 No, dozens of times stronger than the last.
 Or will he fake the punch and use a kick?
 No, he's definitely going to use his fist.
 Then I have no choice.
 I'll sacrifice my eight left
 legs to block his punch,
 while using the right eight to grab him.
 Then I can bite him and inject my venom!
 Let's run a simulation...
 This will work!
 It's just a punch.
 No matter how strong it is,
 if I'm prepared, I can take it!
 Hey, we should get started soon.
 Wait a little longer.
 Screw that!
 You don't have a choice in the matter.
 Now, entertain me.
 Very well...
 What...
 Why are you here?
 This is my castle.
 A king needs no reason to be in his castle.
 There are many drugs here
 that emit strong odors.
 I would expect you to avoid this place.
 Shut up... I like this place!
 What happened to the head of NGL?
 He would have been here.
 Beats me!
 He's probably inside the Queen's belly.
 I'm going to build my own kingdom starting here.
 Then I'll take control of the whole world.
 That will be impossible for a
 boor who amuses himself
 by making dogs of humans.
 Really now?
 I can't wait to strip you down and
 put a collar around your neck!

 Hey! Get down here!
 You only summon me when you're in trouble.
 You'd better watch it.
 I don't have time for small talk.
 Hurry it up.
 Oh, really?
 You're so impatient.
 Are you insulting me?
 Forget about turning you into a dog!
 I'm gonna kill you!
 4!
 Four, huh?
 Damn, bad spin.
 What was that?
 I have no bad spins, bastard!
 Die!
 I'll pretend to attack,
 while I block his punch.
 Then I grab him and bite.
 Here I go!
 Rock... Paper...
 Just as I thought!
 Block!
 Scissors!
 What?
 A-A sword?
 Impossible...
 Where was he hiding that?
 But this could be perfect.
 I can pretend I've been defeated,
 then wait for an opening to bite him!
 You can't relax after dismembering them.
 The head and body can survive
 an entire day after they've been separated.
 You must crush the head.
 And preferably, you'll kill
 them quickly and quietly.
 Oh, it's him!
 The thing that shot us.
 I got a slot machine in my mouth!
 It goes from 1 to 9.
 Each number summons a different weapon.
 This is my Crazy Slot!
 Don't forget the name!
 Just go away.
 That's a strange power...
 It talks by itself?
 Apparently.
 If it uses a slot machine,
 doesn't that mean you can't
 choose your weapon?
 Yes, and I cannot
 change or get rid of the
 weapon I receive until I use it.
 It's very aggravating.
 In that case...
 Why did you come up with this power?
 We've lost the signal from Yunju's team.
 Were they killed?
 The signal indicated three enemies,
 and that they looked tastier than the others.
 They must be rare humans.
 And we have cause to fight.
 Isn't Yunju using that factory as a base?
 So the rare humans should
 still be near the factory.
 Let's go! Tonight, we feast!
 Feast!
 Both of your powers are much
 easier to use than mine.
 Compared to that thing of yours? No kidding.
 Yeah.
 Gon, you appear to have incorporated
 Enhancer, Transmuter, and Emitter
 abilities into your Rock-Paper-Scissors.
 Yep, but my natural affinity
 lies with Enhancer abilities.
 Killua used lightning.
 Are you a Transmuter?
 Yeah, but it's not that strong,
 and I lose energy fast.
 You'll have the chance to improve.
 Let's hurry.
 The nest is close.
 I don't get it...
 I can feel power rushing into me.
 My body is overflowing with energy!
 What is this?!
 What's wrong?
 A signal from one of my soldiers.
 Rammot is acting strangely.
 Rammot?
 Well?
 Look at this!
 I feel reborn!
 Can you see that light, Peggy?
 What tremendous life energy...
 A Chimera Ant has finally
 discovered the power of Nen.

 Inspiration x To x Evolve
 The Hunters Association
 has learned of the Chimera Ants
 from the biological survey team,
 and now awaits the world leaders'
 decision on how to handle them.
 We're counting on you.
 You have a single mission.
 The immediate extermination
 of these dangerous creatures.
 There have already been many casualties.
 We will use any means necessary.
 Will that be acceptable?
 Naturally, we have no intention of
 telling the experts how to proceed.
 We simply desire
 those dangerous creatures
 eradicated as swiftly as possible.
 Understood.
 So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
 leaving the Hunters Association
 to take the blame.
 Th-The Chimera Ants
 have five ranks, w-with the Queen at the top.
 Queen
 There's the Queen.
 Royal Guard
 Under her is the Royal Guard,
 Squadron Leaders
 and then, the Squadron Leaders.
 Under the Squadron Leaders are Captains,
 and they oversee many foot
 soldiers and other grunts.
 A-And once the King is born,
 the hierarchy shifts like so.
 The Royal Guard that followed the Queen
 switches into the King's service.
 A-Afterwards, Squadron Leaders
 report directly to the Queen,
 and she focuses on directing the soldiers.
 The Queen remains in the castle,
 periodically giving birth to Kings.
 The Kings travel and mate
 with different organisms,
 so as to breed new Queens.
 That explains their fast reproduction rate.
 To prevent a Chimera Ant population explosion,
 you must defeat the Queen before
 she can give birth to a King.
 But first, you need to defeat
 all the soldiers guarding her.
 That's a tall order.
 Got it. We'll be waiting.
 The punitive force's first wave is on its way.
 Punitive force?
 I wonder who they'll send.
 They'll be facing those vicious Chimera Ants.
 They'll be strong.
 They'd better be!
 I'm worried about Kite and the kids.
 They'll arrive in three days.
 How?
 Look at this!
 Isn't it incredible?
 Why does Rammot have so much life energy?
 There must have been some catalyst.
 A catalyst...
 Rock...
 Paper...
 Rock!
 That hurts...
 Damn...
 What if their attacks were the catalyst?
 I can feel the power filling me!
 Peggy...
 I told you that we are capable
 of anything that humans are.
 Including the use of this strange power?
 But this is...
 Rammot, while you have that power, hit me.
 Wh-What are you saying?
 You've been ticking me off,
 so I won't go easy on you.
 I'm assuming that's what it takes.
 Then I won't hold back.
 Come.
 Colt!
 This is a message from Hagya.
 This is a message from Hagya.
 The ultimate prey is either
 within the factory or nearby.
 Capture it.
 Capture it...
 Dead or alive.
 Capture it!
 Hagya-sama...
 What is it?
 Do you believe they will succeed?
 There are enough Captains for a decent fight.
 For a decent fight, huh?
 But I doubt they'll be much help.
 I'm fine with that.
 Why is that?
 They're just buying time for us to arrive.
 Oh, I see.
 Then the rare humans will be ours to take.
 Exactly.
 We're surrounded.
 Their numbers are great.
 Now, then...
 Let's decide order and methodology.
 As for our targets, you have three choices.
 One...
 Decide the order in which you will fight.
 Two, attempt to escape.
 Three, give up and let us capture you.
 If you choose option one,
 you will fight one-on-one battles with us
 for a chance to survive.
 I don't recommend the second option.
 You'll anger us, resulting in a brutal capture
 and prolonged suffering for all of you.
 Option three is out of the question.
 That would anger us even more than option two.
 So, what will you do?
 Kite...
 We couldn't have asked for a better deal.
 One-on-one fights with their Captains.
 We'll start with whoever is prepared to fight.
 I'll go.
 No, I will.
 First comes rock!
 Rock, paper, scissors!
 Okay, I'm first!
 While the Ants have inherited
 individualism from humans,
 they've lost the unity that's
 characteristic of ants.
 I hope we'll be able
 to take advantage of that change.
 Well, we need to decide who
 to send from our side.
 #6...
 #6!
 Who's #6?
 Lucky me!
 Baro?
 How will the victor be decided?
 Eh? That should be obvious.
 Whoever dies first loses.
 We can't just surrender?
 What?!
 Are you crazy?
 If you lose, we'll feed you to the Queen.
 If you don't defeat me,
 you're guaranteed to die!
 Yeah, I'm okay with that.
 But there's no need for you to die.
 If I beat you, I won't want to eat you.
 If you surrender, you'll live.
 But if you lose,
 you must promise never to eat another human.
 This guy isn't taking us seriously!
 He has more pep than any human I've seen!
 Lucky you, Baro-chan!
 I'll kill you!
 You managed to dodge that one.
 Then how about this?
 The same attack?
 Gon!
 He altered course.
 I'm fine.
 Why are you so tough?
 By this point, the rest were vomiting organs.
 Whatever...
 Just need a few more times.
 There's no way to dodge my homing roll!
 Indeed...
 He only has to alter his course to
 match the direction Gon dodges.
 What will you do, Gon?
 Kid, I have something to
 tell you before I kill you.
 The main reason we kill humans isn't to eat them
 or to feed them to the Queen.
 Then why?
 Because it's fun!
 I love the sound as humans
 vomit their own organs
 with a plop!
 It's hilarious because it looks like barf.
 That isn't funny.
 I'll make you vomit your own
 organs with a plop, too!
 He didn't dodge...
 But stopped him.
 Compared to Razor's spikes,
 this is nothing!
 Well, we're in a hurry.
 Who's my opponent?
 Hey!
 #3.
 #3's up!
 You won't be smiling for long.
 I'm about to show you hell.
 Got it?
 I'm nothing like the trash over there.
 Trash?
 Huh? I said trash because he's trash.
 I'm ten times stronger than that guy.
 Oh, that's nothing to brag about.
 What was that?!
 When they enter battle,
 their aura becomes much stronger.
 They're at their best in battle.
 Gon tends to have an agitatingly slow start,
 but we should have time.
 We'll reach the Queen before
 she gives birth to the King.
 But why
 do I have such a bad feeling?
 I feel like I'm missing something.
 There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.
 Look, Peggy!
 I can freely control this energy!
 This is incredible!
 We should do more research.
 Eh?
 If we learn the proper way
 to wield this power,
 we can synchronize it with our natural abilities
 to make it an even stronger weapon.
 You're too retentive...
 Zazan...
 She said she captured a rare
 human a few days ago...
 If we're lucky,
 he's still in the storeroom.
 Find and secure him.
 My entire body is covered by hardened skin.
 I can take as many of those
 attacks as you can throw!
 Oh, yeah?
 Is there anyone ten times
 stronger than this guy?
 This is a pleasant surprise.
 Their Captains can be dispatched easily enough.
 Am I worried over nothing?
 That's enough... It's my turn!
 2!
 What?
 Two, huh?
 Damn, bad spin.
 Killua...
 That scythe is nasty.
 Gon, Killua...
 In three seconds, jump up.
 Wh-What is this overwhelming pressure?
 Right!
 I've experienced this sensation before!
 Silent Waltz: Grim Reaper's Dance
 I remember now.
 This is
 death!
 Murder via overwhelming force.
 Get lost.
 This scythe can be used
 only with this technique.
 And it won't disappear until I've used it.
 It's such a drag...
 So why did you choose that power?
 Be cautious as we advance.
 As I mentioned, that won't be
 enough to kill them immediately.
 Are you okay?
 It's only getting worse from here.
 If you start to sympathize with the enemy,
 you won't be able to handle what's coming.
 I'm fine.
 I have no sympathy for bugs
 that call each other trash.
 That's a dangerous view.
 What would you do if one of those
 bugs cared for its comrades?
 Kite, Gon, and Killua head toward
 the Chimera Ant Queen's castle
 to prevent the King's birth.
 Next time: A x Fated x Awakening.
 I'll go.
 No, I will!
 No, me!
 Then I'll go.

 I feel like I'm missing something.
 There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.
 A x Fated x Awakening
 Kite, Gon, and Killua have
 taken care of Hagya's soldiers.
 As they head deeper into NGL in
 search of the Chimera Ants' nest,
 within the Queen's castle,
 one of the soon-to-be-born
 King's three Royal Guards
 is about to awaken.
 What kind of magic did they use?
 Wow, all of them were split cleanly in half.
 Impressive.
 This one almost looks like he was smashed
 by a rock, or some other hard object.
 And Baro's the one with an iron shell.
 So this is the rare humans' power.
 Are you worried now?
 The king of the jungle's blood
 runs through my veins.
 A few humans can't scare me.
 Of course...
 Whew, that's a relief.
 I thought I was gonna miss out on tonight's feast.
 These must be extremely rare humans.
 We'll tear them to shreds and gobble them down!
 We're being followed.
 Not from there.
 There's quite a number of them.
 Listen up...
 Your job is to distract the enemy,
 while attacking from a distance.
 Do not get too close.
 The 2nd Platoon will take the right,
 as the 3rd Platoon pincers
 them from the left.
 My 1st Platoon will trap them,
 preventing a rear retreat.
 Go!
 Gon and I didn't notice them.
 They're coming from the left and the right.
 Keep up your guard.
 Damn...
 The trees are getting in the way.
 Yeah.
 Shouldn't we get out of the forest?
 This is a trap.
 Okay, keep up the chase.
 Hagya-sama, all goes according to plan.
 Good work, Flutter.
 Once we drive our prey into range,
 one strike with my fangs will finish them.
 This doesn't feel right...
 Eh?
 You ordered Flutter to chase the prey,
 while you hid in the grass to ambush them.
 That's pretty lame.
 Huh?
 Aren't you the king of the jungle?
 A king should face his prey, rather than hiding.
 Just jump out and go,
 ""Roar! Chomp! Ga ha ha ha!""
 That's so much cooler.
 But you know...
 This is how the king of the jungle hunts.
 Shut up and watch!
 Yeah, yeah.
 Well, I don't care, so long as I
 get to eat the rare humans.
 Rare human?
 What's that?
 I'll explain the details later.
 Its number is 4-933.
 It was captured and brought
 in by Zazan's squadron.
 Number 4-933...
 Doesn't mean a thing to me.
 It was probably given to the Queen.
 Her appetite is even more insatiable these days.
 She'll give birth to an incredible king.
 Don't see 'em.
 It must already be inside the Queen's belly.
 Are you certain?
 It isn't here...
 Where else would it be?
 Could it have escaped?
 Any creature poisoned by our nerve toxin
 will be paralyzed for at least a month.
 After a mere three days, it couldn't move around.
 You can't be sure when it
 concerns the rare ones.
 They aren't like normal humans.
 You should know that very well.
 I'm not the same creature I was before.
 The next time I see them,
 I'll crush them, rip them apart, and eat them.
 The antidote I hid in my
 back tooth came in handy.
 But I could barely drag myself across the ground.
 For the time being, I'll have to hide here...
 But what's going on?
 How can a Chimera Ant use Nen?
 Could you check once more?
 Come on, give me a break...
 I'm busy enough as it is.
 Didn't you hear me say the Queen
 has a huge appetite now?
 I am well aware of that.
 I don't know anything about this ""rare"" stuff,
 but why are you so obsessed with this human?
 I'd like to ask it a few questions.
 Can't you see the light surrounding his body?
 Light?
 No, I don't see a thing.
 I see.
 Then it's true that only some
 can identify this power.
 Meaning it's a talent.
 Exactly.
 This talent is my destiny, bestowed
 upon me by the heavens.
 The power of a chosen few...
 If I master this power, I can become the king!
 I will be king!
 Retreat! Retreat!
 Hmm? What's wrong, Flutter?
 Wh-What's that?
 He's gorgeous!
 We're leaving.
 Huh?
 What about the feast?
 He was able to understand
 that he was outclassed,
 and he calmly backed down at once.
 Most likely, he was a Squadron Leader.
 I always believed that the world
 revolved around my claws and fangs.
 That if I brandished them,
 I could take the life of any other creature,
 could always satisfy my own hunger...
 And that I was truly blessed.
 However, that wasn't the case.
 Others were stronger,
 so I never could have ruled.
 Death taught me that lesson.
 But I am stronger now.
 At the moment, we may not be
 strong enough to defeat them.
 But now we are armed with the ability to learn.
 We're following them.
 Their nest must be nearby.
 If we follow them,
 we will find the Queen.
 What is that?
 Something is coming!
 That was a fascinating conversation...
 You mentioned something about talent.
 Allow me to take part.
 O-One of the Queen's Royal Guards!
 If I master this power, I can become the king!
 I will be the king!
 A short and foolish dream...
 I am totally outclassed.
 I can never escape the position
 I've been born into...
 You can relax.
 Let's talk over there.
 Y-Yes!
 This power is not for me...
 But for this Royal Guard...
 And for the King it serves!
 This power is for serving them!
 Impossible...
 What is that
 evil aura?
 By the way...
 Yes?
 Why is a live human underneath those bones?
 Hmm... Nyow I understand.
 What are you researching?
 I'm learning about those rare
 humans you mentioned.
 I've attempted to study them many times,
 but it wasn't written in any books.
 Asking one of them is faster
 than flipping through books.
 Wasn't that why you were looking for him?
 Th-That's exactly right.
 There we go.
 Ah!
 ""New memories are stored
 in the hippocampus,
 while old memories are kept
 in the cerebral cortex.
 To invoke those memories...""
 Nyow I understand.
 Ah, you... Come over here.
 Hatsu is a technique for
 manipulating aura at will.
 To summarize the categories of Nen users...
 They are:
 Enhancers,
 Transmuters,
 Conjurers,
 Emitters,
 Manipulators,
 and Specialists,
 for a total of six categories.
 C-Categories...
 Every Nen user belongs to one of these.
 You want to increase the amount of your aura,
 as well as the speed of its flow.
 Most of your basic training will
 be spent on these two tasks.
 In a battle between Nen users,
 those are the factors that...
 That...
 Th-that are pivotal
 in determining the victor.
 Nyow I understand...
 In addition to the basic Nen
 abilities Zetsu and Ren,
 there are also unique techniques that reflect
 the Nen user's individuality.
 If you develop a technique that synchronizes
 with your style and Nen category,
 the manifestation of your ability has
 a better chance of being stronger.
 And how do you identify which
 Nen category you belong to?
 Water divination
 is the simplest
 and most commonly used method.
 Water divination?
 Give it a try, Rammot.
 Right.
 Since the water's overflowing,
 that makes you an Enhancer.
 An Enhancer?
 Which confirms that Rammot is a Nen user?
 Seems so.
 Oh, yeah...
 Didn't you say you fought a rare human?
 Y-Yes.
 The impact from its attack opened your pores...
 And released your aura.
 Pores?
 Apparently, they're small holes all over your body.
 If they're sealed, aura can't be released.
 I see...
 Colt also thought that Rammot's change
 was triggered by his fight
 with the rare humans.
 It seems he was correct.
 So if Rammot is a Nen user now,
 can we use him to open everyone's pores?
 Sure, sounds good.
 I think I'll give this a try.
 The leaf wilted...
 Unbelievable.
 One of us was born possessing Nen ability,
 without having to fight a rare human!
 Then, Commander, that makes you a Specialist,
 not belonging to another category?
 Neferpitou.
 Huh?
 That is the name the Queen gave me.
 From now on, call me Neferpitou.
 Right!
 I don't need him anymore.
 Feed him to the Queen now.
 Right!
 From birth, Neferpitou already
 possessed incredible power.
 This presence casts a dark shadow over the fates
 of Gon and his friends.

 Attention all Squadron Leaders and Captains.
 Commander Neferpitou will hold
 an award ceremony in auditorium one.
 If you are able to endure considerable pain,
 you will receive tremendous power in return.
 That power is to be used for our Queen!
 They're continuing to go straight.
 The Chimera Ant nest must be up ahead.
 Amazing...
 He's been picking them up this entire time,
 never losing them for an instant.
 Kite said he could use En within
 a radius of forty-five meters.
 I've heard that those called Nen masters
 can handle around fifty meters.
 Kite is nearly there.
 Actually, given that he's kept
 it up for an entire night,
 he's probably stronger.
 Stronger than a master...
 Then Kite's the real deal.
 Yeah, he's the first real pro Hunter we've met.
 Tsezgerra was a pro Hunter,
 but we really only knew him
 as another player in a game.
 Bisky was an incredible Hunter.
 But to us...
 Yeah, she was our Nen mentor.
 And the first to teach us about Nen...
 Wing-san was our Nen master and savior.
 Looking back,
 we always meet the right people
 just when we need them most.
 And those people have all made us stronger.
 Razor, too, huh?
 Yeah.
 It's clear that Ging really did create
 Greed Island to train you.
 And once you beat the game,
 he deliberately led you to Kite.
 Ging!
 I'm not sure if Ging predicted what
 would happen when we met Kite.
 But he certainly knew
 that you would like the man who
 had earned Ging's respect.
 And he knew without doubt
 that you would go with Kite.
 He wants us to get stronger by traveling with Kite.
 This is a pretty brutal place for training, though.
 That's why I keep asking if your resolve is firm.
 As you mentioned,
 Ging-san probably had certain
 expectations when he sent you to me.
 But I do not intend to train
 you during this journey.
 We don't have that kind of time.
 I brought you along because I
 thought you might be of use.
 From here, it all comes down to your resolve.
 If it's strong, you'll develop your Nen
 and grow strong via combat.
 If it's weak, the Ants will eat you.
 But we can't die...
 We are pro Hunters.
 Those who call themselves
 Hunters always get their prey.
 For Hunters, that is the first commandment.
 Those who call themselves Hunters
 should always be on the hunt.
 A hunt involves both hunter and prey.
 It is a battle of resolve.
 Emerging victorious from a battle of resolve
 is what makes a successful hunt.
 The loser has to follow the
 winner's rules and customs.
 Usually, this means the loser's death.
 Rules...
 If you don't want that result, then win.
 Improving your Nen is important, of course.
 But to be a successful Hunter, you must
 understand your enemy and yourself.
 Th-That's why...
 That's why you hit me back then!
 Fool!
 Why would you try to enter Snake
 Beech Forest in this season?!
 Look!
 That's a territorial marker
 made by Foxbears with cubs.
 Any animal seeing it knows to get far away!
 That was the forest's rule and custom.
 You taught me the rules in Ging's place.
 Oh...
 That's right... I just remembered.
 A Hunter License?
 What's this?
 This is Ging-san's.
 Huh? It's Ging's?
 Do you remember what my final test was?
 Yeah, to find Ging.
 Before the test began, Ging-san gave this to me.
 He said I should use it to find him...
 I planned to return it to him once I did.
 Huh? He wouldn't take it back?
 No...
 I completely forgot I had it.
 Gon, you said that you're going to
 find Ging-san on your own, right?
 Huh?
 Yeah.
 Then you have to do it.
 And would you return this for me?
 Sure!
 But first, I have to finish this job
 with you and get a lot stronger.
 After that, I'll find Ging and give this back.
 I promise!
 I'm counting on you.
 Well,
 let's get a move on before we lose the trail.
 Take that!
 Next!
 Being average is terrible...
 You have to go to all this trouble
 just to unleash your power.
 Peggy, I'll leave this to you.
 Where are you going?
 I want to find out how strong I really am.
 That's a monster.
 What is this?
 I don't believe it!
 What's wrong, Kite?
 Gon, Killua...
 Run!
 Huh?
 Hurry up!
 Get out of here!
 Found you...
 Get away from me!
 Malice
 Idio—
 Good decision, Killua.
 Take Gon and run!
 This time, you're in big trouble...
 Let's see if you get a good roll!
 3!
 Ah, so you can do stuff like that?
 We were overconfident...
 The two of us were still weaker
 than Kite who'd lost an arm.
 That thing knew.
 This is reality.
 If Kite had been alone,
 this probably wouldn't have happened.
 We were fools!
 Hey...
 Look.
 Huh? You left Kite behind?
 Why?!
 What happened?
 Explain what's going on!
 H-Hey, what are you doing?!
 Yes, I understand.
 Can you wait there a little longer?
 We're headed your way right now.
 We have reinforcements.
 Chairman Netero.
 What's this? They're just kids.
 If you're here to play, you'll get burned.
 Go back home.
 Stop it, Morel-san.
 That isn't nice...
 They're only children.
 You look pretty defeated.
 Was the enemy that strong?
 One of them could use Nen.
 That was the worst aura I've ever encountered.
 Worse than my brother's...
 Worse than Hisoka's...
 Now that I've learned Nen myself, I can tell.
 You guys are unbelievably strong.
 But I still can't see you defeating that thing...
 Whenever humans encounter the unknown,
 they tend to lose perspective.
 Currently, you're experiencing a state of panic.
 We'll take it from here, so go lie in bed.
 You're no better than I am, Knov.
 Kid...
 The minute you start talking about who
 can win in a Nen fight, you're wrong.
 In most cases, you won't know
 your opponent's abilities.
 One instant of carelessness
 is all it takes to turn the tables and cost a life.
 You can't make assumptions based
 on the amount of aura displayed.
 The battle can turn at any point.
 That's what fighting with Nen means.
 But regardless,
 you must always fight certain of victory.
 That is a Nen user's spirit.
 The moment you were overwhelmed
 by the opponent's aura and fled,
 you were disqualified.
 You're lower than a loser!
 Morel, that's enough.
 Is Gon asleep?
 He was going to attack the enemy,
 so I used force to stop him.
 I didn't have time to control my strength,
 so I don't know when he'll wake up.
 That kid shows some promise, then.
 Morel!
 It's difficult to believe that giant
 Chimera Ants are eating humans,
 but since it appears to be true,
 we must keep casualties to a minimum.
 If we send fighters who aren't strong enough,
 they'll only strengthen the enemy.
 Do you understand?
 Yeah.
 That's why there are only three.
 A select few...
 We're not
 strong enough.
 We sent two assassins to the nearest village.
 It's your decision whether you want to fight.
 But you must defeat them before you come.
 If you wish to live as a Hunter...
 We are not desperate for help.
 We only seek the strong.
 Will you fight!? Or not!?
 The moment you were overwhelmed
 by the opponent's aura and fled,
 you were disqualified.
 You're lower than a loser!
 I am no longer qualified...
 Killua...
 Thanks.
 Why would you thank me?
 Weren't you the one who stopped me?
 Had I lost control back there,
 I would've gotten in Kite's way.
 Then, all three of us could have died.
 But I...
 I let Kite die...
 Kite is alive!
 He wouldn't ever let that thing beat him!
 But considering his injury,
 he'd have a hard time moving around.
 So he's probably hiding.
 Waiting for us to return!
 So we should hurry back...
 Once we're stronger.
 To save Kite!
 Gon...
 You are light.
 Yeah, you're right.
 Sometimes, you shine so
 brightly, I must look away.
 But even so, is it still okay
 if I stay at your side?
 Let's go.
 To become stronger!
 We welcome you anytime!!
 Prepare a freezer in the castle.
 We need one that can store
 over a hundred humans.
 To ensure that our collection doesn't rot.
 Yep.
 I think
 I'm pretty strong.
 Next time: Promise x and x Reunion.
 It has to be Killua...
 Stay asleep in the chair, man.

 Promise x and x Reunion
 Gon and Killua have vowed to save Kite.
 But before they can return to NGL,
 they must pass the condition
 set by Chairman Netero,
 leader of the punitive force.
 What are those?
 Tokens.
 You take a piece of marked wood and split it,
 giving each half to a different person.
 They work as proof that you're an ally
 or to authenticate a document.
 We sent two assassins to the nearest village.
 In this case,
 each of the two assassins
 holds one matching token.
 We defeat them and take the tokens.
 It's been erased.
 That means someone checked the board.
 Yeah.
 You must be Killua and Gon.
 Nice to meet you.
 My name is Palm.
 It's a pleasure.
 Oh, dear...
 No need to be so tense.
 I imagine the Chairman probably didn't provide many details.
 Allow me to explain.
 Why don't we have some tea?
 I am a student of Knov-sensei.
 He said I would only get in his way...
 But I insisted on accompanying him.
 Who's that?
 She probably means one of the
 guys with Chairman Netero.
 Yes, the one wearing a black suit...
 My teacher is an incredible person.
 Cool, intelligent, composed...
 Ah, composed and cool mean the same thing!
 Oh, dear...
 Oh, but I only respect him, that's all.
 There's nothing romantic about my feelings...
 At least, I may wish that were the case.
 After all, when it comes to falling
 in love, respect is a major factor.
 Ah, my teacher knows nothing
 about this, of course.
 I haven't said a word to him,
 and I don't intend to.
 No one can say what will happen...
 After all, love is a spontaneous thing,
 don't you agree?
 Uh, can I interrupt you?
 Aren't we supposed to fight you?
 Huh? Oh, dear...
 Yes, I apologize.
 The Chairman and my teacher
 said I couldn't accompany them any farther.
 But I insisted on going with them.
 It feels like I spent a lifetime just trying
 to convince them of my determination.
 And finally, they relented, with one condition.
 Uh, I'm asking about...
 My teacher may appear a cold person,
 but he's actually quite gentle.
 But you have to spend a lot of
 time with him to realize that.
 Ah, by ""spending time with him,"" I don't mean—
 Okay! What's the condition?!
 Knuckle and Shoot's defeat.
 To think those vulgar, barbaric unmannered brats
 will be allowed inside NGL before me...
 I cannot allow that.
 Palm-san, turn off your Hatsu!
 She's an Enhancer like me.
 I'm not too happy about that.
 Knuckle and Shoot?
 Not us?
 That's right.
 After all, I'm not the one who's
 supposed to defeat Knuckle and Shoot.
 You two are.
 Knuckle and Shoot are Morel-san's students.
 They, too, received a condition.
 I don't know what that condition was...
 But whether it's us or them, only one
 group will be allowed into NGL.
 The deadline is one month.
 Since we were told to keep
 these tokens for a month,
 that means someone will come for them.
 What do we do, Knuckle?
 That's easy.
 He who strikes first, wins!
 Find 'em...
 And kill 'em!
 Certain Death
 My name is Knuckle Bine!
 I am a Beast Hunter!
 I challenge the two punitive
 force candidates to a duel!
 Come tonight at midnight sharp, and face me!
 Bring it on
 I won't try to run or hide.
 I won't bring any weapons or allies.
 It'll just be me and me alone.
 So come and fight me!
 But where?
 The location?
 You have to tell them where to find you.
 Bring it on
 A man never turns his back on an enemy.
 I'll follow you to the ends of the Earth...
 You won't get away!
 Even if he said where, I wouldn't go.
 He's just a decoy.
 His partner's probably hidden
 somewhere, watching.
 They're watching to see if
 anyone reacts suspiciously.
 According to Palm, they don't
 even know our names.
 Yeah.
 So their goal must be to smoke us out.
 No one's stupid enough to do all that for real.
 Did he look strong?
 He's pretty strong.
 What will it take to defeat him?
 I have no idea!
 One of the Hunters with the Chairman said that
 In a Nen battle, nothing is certain.
 So, according to him,
 it's wrong for me to judge if a fight can be won.
 I disagree.
 If you want to survive, you must
 increase your odds of victory.
 Gauging the strength differential between
 you and an opponent is crucial.
 If you're up against someone you can only beat
 once or twice out of a
 hundred times, don't bother.
 You need at least a fifty-percent chance.
 If possible, greater than
 seventy percent is preferable.
 To reach that, we must do two things...
 Work on our fundamentals, and learn
 more about our opponents' abilities.
 Right.
 If we know our opponents' abilities,
 it'll be easier to plan ahead.
 Like we did against Genthru.
 I'm half agreed, and half opposed.
 What do you mean?
 I think we should work on our fundamentals,
 but I don't think we need to know their abilities.
 Huh? Why not?
 That just increases our risk of defeat.
 Nothing good can come of that!
 But that's what we'll be facing in NGL.
 Our goal isn't to defeat Knuckle and Shoot...
 It's to become stronger,
 and return to NGL and save Kite.
 In other words,
 we must be strong enough to defeat
 enemies we know nothing about.
 Winning here with advance
 preparation is pointless.
 That's true,
 but we have to defeat these opponents first.
 After all, we only have a month.
 That's too long.
 One week.
 In one week, we'll be stronger,
 and heading back to NGL!
 Go—
 Are you an idiot?!
 Bisky!
 Why are you here?
 I asked her to come.
 Huh? You know each other?
 No, I looked into your backgrounds.
 How?
 We only know Bisky because...
 Once I used my power, it was quite simple.
 Now, there's no time to spare.
 Let's begin...
 The plan to slaughter Morel's disciples.
 Um, no.
 Let's get started, then.
 Osu!
 What was that for?!
 I'm picking up where I left off.
 Are you stupid?
 That old man's famous for his nasty nature.
 If he tells you to do something in a month,
 it probably should take an entire year.
 You won't defeat them after a week!
 But we have to hurry back and save Kite.
 What are you talking about?
 That was fun...
 Like a dream come true.
 I'd love to fight you...
 once more.
 I see...
 All the more reason you shouldn't
 return without proper training!
 What if you make the same mistake again?!
 So typical of her age.
 She's always ready with a lecture.
 Got it?
 Osu...
 Let's start training, then.
 Begin with Ren!
 Maintain that for three hours.
 Killua, how long can you last?
 In top condition, I can manage
 around fifty-five minutes, max.
 Until you complete this,
 we can't move to the next step.
 Train like your lives are on the line!
 Come on.
 You didn't even last an hour.
 Okay, keep working.
 They say it takes a month to add ten
 minutes to your Ren endurance.
 You won't have time to sleep.
 Curses...
 Those damn cowards ran away!
 You bastards deserve to die now!
 You have a collar.
 Where's your owner?
 You're supposed to keep the park clean.
 Okay, you can rest for today!
 Tomorrow begins in thirty minutes.
 Looks like it's time for me to use my power.
 Take it away, Cookie-chan.
 Magical Esthetician: Piano Massage.
 Pink Relief
 Excuse me...
 I hope this won't offend you,
 but I'll let you decide how to train them.
 Since my power told me that
 you would be the answer.
 However,
 if they cannot defeat Morel's
 disciples after one month,
 I doubt I'll be able to restrain myself.
 I absolutely must go to NGL.
 Honestly, I want to depart this moment.
 So after I've waited and waited
 and waited and waited and waited,
 if this fails now,
 I'll probably kill all of you...
 Was that a threat?
 No, it's a warning.
 I'm worried about you all.
 So if you think they have no chance,
 I recommend that you leave...
 Speaking from experience, I'm less
 likely to lose my temper that way.
 I'm not the one you should tell.
 Once they're awake, tell the boys.
 Don't worry! We've got this!
 You can count on us to get you to NGL.
 So let us know if you notice anything.
 We'll do our best.
 That's how they are.
 Have some faith.
 Oh, dear!
 This won't do at all...
 Anyway, I'm more concerned about
 what's happening inside NGL.
 What is the Chairman's group
 doing for the next month?
 Well?!
 Ah, well...
 They mentioned they'd be poking and probing.
 Identifying the enemy's strengths,
 and weakening their forces...
 The experts can't agree on the amount of time
 remaining before the King's birth.
 The Chairman is operating with two months,
 the earliest prediction, as the deadline.
 This is bad.
 That thing is stronger than I am.
 Stronger than the Chairman?
 Surely you jest.
 If that's really true,
 none of the Hunters will be able to fight it.
 It's been more than half a century since
 I was the strongest among Nen users.
 Now, I'm more or less even with you guys.
 Then you're more than strong enough.
 You should have more confidence.
 Even when I'm at less than half my former strength?
 Growing old is no fun.
 He never stops talking.
 But we must fight.
 I would prefer to avoid it...
 If there were a solution that would
 avoid a fight, I'd choose it.
 Our target is the Queen,
 and the Queen alone.
 But sneaking past the surveillance of
 that En will be next to impossible.
 We cannot avoid a fight...
 The question is how we will manage to win.
 If anyone has any brilliant ideas,
 I'd like to hear them.
 You're simply awful.
 When you asked us to join, did you not
 already have an answer in mind?
 We exterminate the Ants
 in silence, one at a time.
 Yeah, let's take it slow.
 Might as well enjoy the job...
 Okay...
 First, we should learn the enemy's numbers.
 Go.
 So many.
 Something is coming.
 They aren't alive...
 Is this the enemy's power?
 Now, what to do?
 You may as well wait.
 If they come here, we simply destroy them.
 You have a point.
 These could be decoys.
 Huh, what?
 Was I speaking aloud?
 No.
 I simply knew what you were thinking.
 Who are you, anyway?
 One of the Queen's Royal Guard.
 Shaiapouf.
 Menthuthuyoupi will also soon awaken.
 Nyow I see. So you're Shaiapouf.
 Yes, that is correct.
 You can read all my thoughts.
 Not sure I like that.
 Well, I can understand the sentiment.
 But...
 He will wake soon.
 That's good news!
 You see, I haven't been able to
 decide what power to develop.
 Right, it's so simple.
 I merely need to fix him.
 I only need the power to do that.
 And then, I will be able to experience
 that dreamlike moment with you
 once more...
 Come on, what are you doing?
 You'll never defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
 much less the Chimera Ants, like this.
 Are you giving up on going to NGL?
 N-No way...
 We never give up.
 We must return to NGL, no matter
 what we have to do to get there!
 To save Kite...
 After reuniting with Bisky,
 Gon and Killua are back to training.
 They have one goal:
 to get strong enough to save Kite.
 Right now, that motivation is driving Gon.
 Next time: Duel x and x Escape.
 It's on, Killua!
 It's on, Gon!

 Promise x And x Reunion
 As the Queen prepares for the King's birth,
 she requires the equivalent of two hundred
 and fifty human meatballs per day
 to give birth to a strong King.
 It moved.
 Meanwhile, Gon and Killua
 continue their training so they
 can defeat Knuckle and Shoot,
 take their tokens, and return to NGL.
 Will this really be enough for
 them to execute the plan
 to slaughter Morel's disciples?
 Okay, all done!
 You finally lasted for three hours.
 We did it...
 That was hard!
 I can't move an inch...
 What are you talking about?
 Stand up.
 We're going out.
 Huh?
 Where to?
 To see Knuckle.
 Wh-Why?
 See? You can move.
 Let's go!
 Tell us why we're going to see Knuckle.
 Jeez, don't ask questions
 with obvious answers.
 To fight him!
 Huh?!
 Okay, let's go!
 What are you talking about?
 We still have time.
 What if we lose?
 You just try again.
 Huh?
 Whether you win or lose isn't important.
 All that matters is who ends
 up with the tokens, right?
 Yeah.
 Which means you must take theirs.
 If it looks like you'll lose, run.
 Then try again the next day.
 From here on, you'll practice
 Ren for three hours a day.
 After that, you'll challenge Knuckle.
 And you'll continue until you win.
 Still a no show, huh?
 Your owner's really bad...
 Hey, stop it!
 That tickles.
 Cut it out!
 Hey, come on...
 Is that Knuckle?
 Yeah.
 No way...
 They're the other candidates?
 Guess they must not respect me...
 If I'm being compared to a couple of kids,
 they must not think I'm very strong...
 Eh?!
 Such an intimidating presence...
 We should act first, but we can't move!
 A duel is a battle to the death.
 Serious business!
 It's best to fight five hours
 after a good night's sleep.
 So what's with you kids?
 You're completely worn out!
 Were you just out swimming or something, eh?
 Take this seriously!
 You kids can never defeat me.
 Are you crying?
 S-Stupid...
 Wh-Why would I cry?
 I'm not upset about this.
 Th-Th-These are just, well, uh...
 Tears from laughing too much, fool.
 I'll kill you, get it?
 So don't tell anyone!
 Punch me!
 Huh?
 I'll show you how much stronger I really am.
 And you'll realize that I don't need
 to bother dodging your punches.
 Hit me as many times as you like.
 But if I don't take a step from this spot,
 leave your tokens behind.
 This is the best chance you'll have!
 You kids would need a hundred years
 before you could try fighting me!
 You're the one who challenged us to a duel.
 Don't look down on us!
 I'd like to respond that way...
 But it's clear that we aren't on Knuckle's level.
 We have no right to argue that.
 Not right now...
 The fact is,
 we can't overcome everything with willpower.
 We can't argue with him...
 But we don't have to accept it!
 I won't stop hitting you until you move.
 Enough talk...
 Just get to it.
 First comes rock!
 Whoa, whoa, whoa...
 What's with the intense aura?
 That's cheating!
 I'll use Gyo...
 No, I have to defend with Ko.
 Crap...
 But where do I defend?
 If I guess wrong,
 I could die...
 Come on...
 I'd expect him to attack the belly.
 Yeah, that's the only real choice.
 Gotta be the belly.
 Rock...
 Yeah, it's the belly!
 Belly! Belly! Belly!
 Paper...
 Rock!
 Knuckle-san?
 You okay?
 I... trusted... you...
 What's with him?
 Obviously, he's a total idiot.
 Oh, are you awake?
 You're stronger than I thought.
 Guess I underestimated you...
 Why didn't you take this?
 You should've taken the
 token and ditched me.
 We don't want your token.
 We want the strength to defeat
 you in a straight-up fight.
 Could I ask you something?
 Sure, go ahead.
 Why did you become a Beast Hunter?
 Huh?
 It's a long story...
 And it brings back bad memories.
 Then, why did you volunteer for the punitive force?
 Simply put, to keep it from doing its job.
 I don't like the idea of cutting off
 whatever doesn't fit the mold.
 My teacher says I'm just a softy.
 But you can't judge something that
 you've never seen before...
 First, you have to exchange blows.
 And you'll get yourself killed in the process!
 You're a good kid.
 Now that we've fought, I see that.
 You, too.
 Huh?
 You!
 He wouldn't leave your side.
 They say good Hunters are well-liked by animals.
 S-Stupid!
 I'm not crying...
 Don't tell anyone!
 Or I'll kill you...
 Morel's student...
 It's good!
 Fight me any time you want.
 Huh?
 I'll give you as many tries as you want.
 But it's impossible for you to beat me
 in the twenty days left.
 Good stuff.
 What is this smoke?
 Where am I?
 All right...
 Let's begin, then.
 What?
 Chiona's squadron is missing?
 Yes...
 Is it similar to what happened
 to Reikei's squadron?
 It appears so.
 The leader disappeared first,
 and then the rest vanished, one by one.
 Are the humans fighting back?
 Well, that is the logical conclusion.
 We've been cutting down on
 the number of soldiers,
 and our prey has begun to scatter.
 If humans target us during an extended hunt,
 it could be trouble.
 Should we ask the Queen to move the castle?
 No, we can't trouble the Queen right now.
 Then we ask Neferpitou-dono to investigate?
 That idea doesn't thrill me...
 I'll let you handle things outside...
 We'll protect the inside of the castle.
 I'll try to strengthen this.
 Just as I expected...
 Well, at least she doesn't issue
 any strange orders on a whim.
 We should start by determining
 our current troop strength.
 How many Squadron Leaders remain?
 Assuming Chiona was taken out, twenty-eight.
 Each Squadron Leader has four or five officers...
 And each officer commands
 ten to fifteen soldiers.
 Some squadrons are under tight control,
 but many are free to wander around.
 The missing four squadrons fall
 under the latter category...
 Of the remaining squadrons,
 over half lack discipline.
 And none will heed a warning.
 They've become arrogant since learning Nen.
 Then we could use them to lay a trap.
 I'm sure that's what's currently going
 through the enemy's mind...
 Well, we should be able to
 continue the current plan.
 Yes.
 Knov and I will be able to tell
 once a trap has been laid.
 In fact, I believe we should
 spring a few of those traps.
 Hmm?
 If we ignore the disciplined squads,
 they'll band together and cause us problems.
 Most likely, they'll start pairing
 disciplined and undisciplined squads together.
 If we launch an indiscriminate
 attack, it will result in chaos.
 We should be able to eliminate
 another three or four squads
 before the enemy tries another approach.
 I can already see their next move.
 If all goes well, we'll finish up
 before reinforcements arrive.
 I hope
 things go that way.
 Okay, three hours! All done!
 Well, then... Get going.
 Here.
 What, there are more of you?
 Don't hold back...
 Help yourselves.
 They're here.
 It's on, Knuckle!
 Yeah, let's go!
 I'll take you both on at once!
 I won't say a word about
 how you're condescending to us...
 We're more than happy to accept!
 Let's go, Killua!
 Yeah!
 Come on...
 I have no time to waste playing
 around with you kids.
 You have nothing but time.
 Get serious!
 That's more like it!
 Their bodies are completely fatigued.
 All that's moving them is sheer willpower.
 Once they've accomplished
 the tough task before them,
 they'll gain a confidence boost
 that will spur their growth.
 However, to complete that task,
 they must defeat me!
 And that ain't gonna happen
 on my watch!
 Come on!
 That all you've got?
 Given his personality,
 he's probably already warmed
 to these opponents...
 I doubt he'd sell me out,
 but it's probable that he'll accidentally
 say something he shouldn't.
 My chance will come after they leave.
 I will defeat them...

 The man targeting Gon and Killua
 is named Shoot McMahon.
 He, too, is one of Morel's students.
 This won't work.
 In our current condition,
 we don't stand a chance...
 Yeah.
 I'm pretty sure that Knuckle's using
 less than half of his strength.
 Probably so.
 But we have to fight him.
 Yeah...
 I don't sense anyone else around.
 It's the perfect chance.
 When I take my target down, I am
 always deliberate and thorough.
 That's what it takes to be a UMA Hunter.
 Here we go... This is my chance.
 What's wrong?
 It's the perfect opportunity.
 Right now, I can easily...
 Go...
 Go!
 Shoot McMahon...
 He is a coward.
 Hey, Killua...
 Why wasn't Knuckle-san good enough?
 Hmm? What do you mean?
 Why didn't they let him go to NGL?
 He seems really strong to me.
 Well, that's true.
 In terms of physical ability,
 he'd be a match for Kite.
 It's probably a mental thing.
 Mental?
 His approach isn't in line
 with this mission's objective.
 He's too soft.
 And he gets attached to animals too easily.
 And he did end up volunteering
 to help us, somehow...
 And the number of dogs around keeps increasing.
 Yeah...
 They can maintain their Ren for two hours
 without having to really concentrate.
 That's a good sign...
 If they can do it for three hours,
 I might consider letting them fight
 Knuckle when they're fully rested.
 Knuckle will then be forced
 to use his full strength.
 I hope it will be enough to teach them...
 That which they lack, that which they need.
 But that still only takes them halfway.
 If everything goes well, it'll take them
 about ten days to reach that point.
 And that means they'll have no more
 than a day left before time's up...
 I'm not sure they can make it.
 I should probably prepare for my escape...
 Save my own skin.
 Help yourself.
 Thanks!
 Yum!
 What do you think?
 Oh, this is really good!
 Not that!
 We only have ten days.
 Huh?
 From what I've seen,
 you're only two-thirds through your training
 to become strong enough
 to force Knuckle into using his full strength...
 Uh-oh...
 She knows exactly what's going on.
 Huh? Is that true, Bisky?
 But it'll be fine!
 We'll definitely beat him before the deadline!
 How can you be so sure?!
 The situation hasn't improved at all...
 You said it was all right for
 me to speak up, so I will.
 You have no chance to defeat Knuckle!
 They didn't give you enough time...
 Lately, I find myself gripping a kitchen knife,
 staring at it to calm myself.
 That means I'm nearly over the edge,
 so if you run at once, before it's too late,
 I probably won't try to chase and kill you.
 If not for her outbursts...
 This would be a pleasant meal...
 We aren't gonna run away.
 How many times do I have to say it?
 What else can you do?
 As you currently are, you cannot defeat Knuckle!
 We'll win!
 Pinky swear.
 Come on... Hurry up!
 I pinky swear that we'll beat Knuckle
 and Shoot before the deadline.
 If I break my promise, I have to
 swallow a thousand needles...
 Pinky sworn!
 On the island I'm from, there's another part.
 You go like this and put your thumbs together.
 Sealed with a kiss!
 Okay, now it's a promise.
 By the way, Palm-san,
 what did you use to flavor this?
 Oh... Ah, it's broth from chicken bones...
 Gon's getting really good at handling Palm.
 I suspect she's the one leading
 things in that direction...
 I let a Kunai chicken cook overnight,
 then I let it sit for another night.
 Ten days left.
 Don't say that like a countdown to our death!
 This is it...
 Smoke that covers the forest like fog.
 Baital squad here.
 Goran, give me an update.
 Goran, do you read me?
 Goran!
 Could they have already taken him out?
 Anyone from Goran's squad out there?
 Give me a report!
 Hey...
 We can't see anything with all this smoke...
 We've been trying to reach Squadron
 Leader Goran, but he won't respond!
 Any sign of the leader?
 I can't see the guy in front
 of me! What's going on?!
 I've lost contact with him!
 He was right beside me a moment ago!
 I can't see a thing!
 He just vanished into the smoke!
 Yah! There's a hole!
 With all these messages,
 I can't tell what's happening...
 They should've established a communication
 network to operate in the leader's absence.
 Baital squad, forward!
 Find Goran's squadron and converge with them.
 Zemu and Pokoro squadrons will act
 as rearguard for the Baital squad!
 Proceed in a V formation!
 The number of soldiers is dropping.
 What's happening?
 Now.
 Hey, Baital?
 So you're next?
 Are you sure this is a good idea?
 What do you mean?
 All we do is send enemies to the old man.
 He's the one who takes them out.
 This is a little too easy.
 But it is a surefire method.
 Can't argue there.
 The Chairman was being modest...
 He's still much stronger than we are.
 And he seems rather excited about this.
 Oh, speak of the devil.
 Keep sending them my way.
 I'm finally starting to regain my touch.
 Impressive...
 And how about the Queen?
 She hasn't made a move.
 The Queen is still holed up in her nest.
 Then the King hasn't been born yet.
 Continue to monitor the situation.
 Roger that.
 The old man's on a roll.
 Shall we grab another squadron?
 Yeah.
 Baital and Gafutsu's squadrons haven't returned.
 We're down to fourteen squadrons.
 Damned humans.
 How are they managing to whittle us down?
 I don't know.
 All I know is that there are some
 humans who are very strong.
 We know too little about humans.
 They appear to possess a variety
 of powers far stronger than ours.
 Had we more time, we could
 obtain that power, as well.
 However, once the King is born,
 we will hold the advantage.
 Yes, I hope that will be the case.
 You want to come out?
 Not yet.
 It's still too early.
 Okay, that's three hours!
 Oh? Already?
 That seemed fast.
 Then I'll give you a thirty-minute break.
 Huh?
 Aren't we supposed to fight Knuckle now?
 You can go once you're rested.
 Defeat him.
 You have a little over a day
 before the Chairman's deadline.
 This may be your first and last chance.
 Well, if they're able to fight at full strength,
 they'll have to accept the results, win or lose.
 If they can each identify what they're missing,
 then this training was a success.
 Now, the problem is figuring out my escape...
 Seems you kids are serious tonight.
 Morning, Youpi.
 Youpi?
 To be precise, your name is Menthuthuyoupi.
 I'm hungry.
 Before we begin, I want to
 know where your partner is.
 Eh? You mean Shoot?
 Yeah.
 Why do you want to know that?
 You're about to get the crap knocked out of you.
 We need both tokens.
 That's a riot!
 If you defeat me, I'll tell you.
 We might not get a chance to ask you then.
 You might be out cold.
 You're no longer amusing me...
 There!
 Gon!
 That hit hard.
 I could feel the impact
 throughout my entire body.
 If I drop my Ken, his next
 punch will knock me out.
 After another four or five warm-up punches,
 I'll get serious...
 Better watch yourself.
 I warm up fast.
 Still no one coming out today?
 No.
 As expected, they've holed up inside.
 Shall we make our move?
 No, we're approaching the
 deadline for your disciples.
 We can wait until that's over.
 Judging by the estimated number of
 bodies currently stored in the nest,
 they'll need to replenish in a week or so.
 I would like to dispatch another
 two or three squadrons at that time.
 Okay, I'll leave it in your hands.
 We don't move until we know
 how our disciples performed.
 I think it's a waste of time...
 Knuckle and Shoot might be able to help,
 but the old man's kids don't seem too reliable.
 We can't count on them for anything in a fight.
 At best, they could act as decoys.
 Hell, they'd probably get in our way...
 I'm certain of it.
 That old man always was a gambler...
 Want to bet whose disciples
 will show up tomorrow?
 I'll put 100,000 Jenny on Knuckle and Shoot.
 If we're both wrong,
 the Chairman gets the money.
 How about it?
 Sure.
 Then, I'll put...
 ...1,000,000 on them.
 Huh? That's just impossible!
 Are you trying to throw your money to the dogs?
 The Chairman is a dog?
 I happen to love gambling.
 I always roll high...
 There!
 Behind you, fool!
 He's still warming up?
 Damn, he's strong!
 But why is Knuckle...
 Could it be...
 Hey, aren't you going to use
 that ""First comes rock"" thing?
 Well, you won't be able to use that technique.
 It's flawed, after all.
 It's flawed?
 A word of advice...
 If you try that technique,
 I'll stop you in your tracks.
 In a one-on-one match, you'd better not try it.
 Your technique
 has two huge weaknesses!
 I'm not sure I can accomplish this mission
 without sacrificing someone...
 Next time: Compassion x And x Strength.
 And love and sorrow!
 And reassurance...
 No biggie!

89,"Your technique
 has two huge weaknesses!
 Compassion x And x Strength
 Gon has finally challenged
 Knuckle to a serious fight.
 However, Knuckle claims that
 Gon's technique has serious flaws.
 So, Gon...
 What did you name that technique?
 Oops! I think I forgot to name my attack.
 Ja-Janken!
 Wow, zero effort...
 Jajanken...
 I understand.
 You combined ""jajan"" for ""ta-dah,"" with
 ""janken"" for your attack, ""Rock-Paper-Scissors.""
 Ah, no...
 The first ""ja"" was a stutter.
 Not a bad name, kid!
 Uh, yeah.
 Guess I'm okay with that.
 You are?!
 Gon, your Jajanken has two huge weaknesses.
 First, it takes too long to charge.
 During a fight, you don't have time
 to stand still for several seconds.
 I wouldn't count on having the time to charge it.
 I know that.
 Second, it's too risky.
 When you focus aura in your
 fist to increase power,
 you have less aura for defense.
 One attack to the wrong place
 will take you out, fool!
 I know the risks.
 That's why I've spent the past month
 training to compensate for them!
 Now that I see it again,
 his aura really is something.
 In terms of volume, he has
 as much as a mid-level pro.
 He's so close...
 But you still lack
 experience.
 You haven't been in
 enough real fights!
 You've got plenty of determination.
 It seems you've looked death
 in the eye many times,
 and you have natural talent.
 However, you're still unrefined.
 Your aura is too rough!
 I can tell which area you're defending.
 I can see what you're trying to do.
 Your aura gives it all away.
 So if I use that information to fake you out,
 shifting your intended point of attack...
 This is the result!
 Damn...
 His aura is giving away his every move!
 I was right! Knuckle really is...
 Okay, then...
 Time to throw a real punch.
 He's so...
 Don't blame me if you die.
 He's so gentle!
 Behind you, fool!
 Without his warning, I could have died.
 First, it takes too long to charge.
 He's teaching me when he doesn't have to...
 And providing guidance.
 He's telling me how to become stronger.
 He's too gentle!
 First comes rock...
 I told you that you won't pull off that attack.
 Don't fool around with me!
 That was your full strength?
 Which one of us is fooling around?!
 It's supposed to be a serious fight!
 You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!
 First comes rock...
 Here I go!
 Rock...
 Over here!
 First comes rock...
 Rock...
 Bastard...
 He faked me out with his Jajanken.
 It's obvious that you're focused
 on stopping my special attack.
 Even I could tell exactly when your
 right arm was going to strike.
 He's using Jajanken's weakness, the long
 charge time, against his opponent.
 He's playing mind games.
 Knuckle sees Gon's Jajanken as an easy pitch.
 He has to swing for it.
 It's a perfect pitch, right down the
 middle, that he has to send flying.
 That's the trigger.
 When you see the easy ball, you tense up.
 You can hit it. You have to.
 These thoughts make you use
 more strength than necessary.
 The same thing applies to aura.
 If a Nen user doesn't control their aura,
 it will gather in areas of tension.
 The moment of the swing, it intensifies further.
 If the Nen user is inexperienced or out of control,
 the aura will either stagnate
 or just flow too freely.
 The flow of the aura
 lets the opponent sense
 when an attack will come.
 You should be fighting to kill, Knuckle!
 By calling him out for being soft,
 Gon threw Knuckle off.
 As a result, he managed to fake Knuckle out.
 I'd think this tactic would be more effective
 on those who know Jajanken's strength.
 Opponents who have seen how
 strong the technique can be
 will be more scared and likely to lose
 control when they see it coming.
 The fake-out will be more believable,
 and if the enemy steps back,
 they're easier to hit with Scissors or Paper.
 I always assumed Jajanken
 would be less useful once opponents
 figured out how it works.
 That it was flawed.
 But I was wrong.
 It can be adapted to any situation.
 Okay, let's try this again.
 In the second attempt, he was
 too focused on the technique
 and let Knuckle land a kick on him.
 But if he learns to better control his aura
 in response to the opponent's movement,
 it will be harder to distinguish between
 fake and real Jajanken attempts.
 Gon's been thinking how to shore
 up his technique's weaknesses.
 No...
 He thought of the solution during this fight.
 He's making incredible progress while fighting.
 I'm already getting tired.
 We haven't even been
 fighting for twenty minutes.
 Moving so much is sapping my energy.
 If an hour of training is comparable
 to ten minutes of fighting,
 I'll only be able to maintain my Ken for another ten minutes.
 If my aura defense goes down, I'm finished.
 Before then, I have to end this.
 By using Jajanken.
 Bring it!
 Knuckle definitely has superior physical strength.
 But Gon is adapting, little by little.
 By increasing the area his aura covers,
 he reduces the damage from miscalculations.
 And he's getting used to Knuckle's speed.
 Sudden punches almost never hit him anymore.
 But he's running out of time.
 He doesn't have much stamina
 left to maintain his aura.
 On the other hand, Knuckle has
 been conserving his strength,
 only attacking with physical blows.
 Jajanken requires a large
 amount of aura just to charge.
 A fake Jajanken still drains a fair amount.
 Gon's already activated his technique three times.
 They started fighting twenty minutes ago.
 If he uses Jajanken again,
 he'll only have a minute or two
 to fight at full strength.
 Gon...
 You told me to use my full strength,
 but you're no match for me right now.
 You're...
 First comes
 rock...
 Why?
 What...
 is he going to do?
 First comes
 rock...
 Why?
 Knuckle's in good shape and alert,
 and he's attacking from that distance?
 He isn't even going to hit Knuckle.
 This is definitely Gon's final attack.
 This will end it.
 Rock... Scissors...
 Paper!
 An Emitter attack?
 But it's much weaker than his Rock.
 You're definitely an Enhancer.
 Your power as an Emitter is far lower.
 No speed... No punch.
 He can't have any more tricks up his sleeve.
 Once I knock that aside, it's over!
 Once again!
 Once again?
 He used that ball as cover
 to move behind me?
 Crap!
 Two Jajankens in a row...
 Rock!
 He must have depleted his
 aura before Rock hit.
 Otherwise, I'd be the one on the ground...
 Where are you going, fool?
 I'm going back.
 Aren't you going to fight?
 I'm fine here.
 You can fight Gon again tomorrow.
 The outcome will probably be different.
 I'll defeat Shoot.
 Tell Gon this.
 Tomorrow, I'll be fighting for real.
 He'd better be prepared to die.
 It sounds like you're trying to convince yourself.
 Sure you're up to the task?
 Hell, yeah, fool.
 Tomorrow...
 As long as you win,
 it's fine if you don't get serious.
 But if you lose without fighting at full strength,
 I won't forgive you.
 I'll never forgive you, as long as I live.
 You're still soft.
 Why are you helping the enemy?
 And the enemy is blasting you for it, as well...
 If you don't want to go to NGL,
 hand over your token to them.
 Though I'm sure that they'll refuse it.
 Bastard...
 You're pretty cocky when you aren't
 shaking in your boots, eh?
 The past month, all you've done is stalk them!
 I'll fight.
 Tomorrow, I'll join the fight.
 Don't worry.
 I gave him a massage, so he'll be able to fight
 in top condition tomorrow.
 Killua's the real issue...
 I wasn't expecting him to go
 the whole month without fighting once.
 Killua!
 Fight me.
 Huh?
 What happened to your face, Killua?!
 Huh? I was training with Bisky.
 Training? Are you sure it wasn't a lynching?
 Anyway, are you feeling okay?
 Yep, I feel great.
 I used up all my aura, so I expected
 to be tired, but look!
 That gorillâ€”
 That old hag's massage must have done the trick.
 That was close.
 Listen now...
 If you tell anyone what happened yesterday,
 I'll make your face three times worse.
 She wasn't joking.
 Now, do you know your weakness?
 You're too quick to give up.
 You're too cautious about fighting.
 Some might say you underestimate yourself.
 When facing an enemy you
 believe to be stronger,
 you fight on the premise of escaping.
 I realize that this isn't your fault.
 It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.
 Habits that are burned into your
 body and soul aren't easy to break.
 But I can say one thing for sure.
 Somewhere down the line,
 you'll leave Gon behind to die.
 Combat ability can change,
 depending on environment
 and physical condition.
 For example, a good-condition C
 has a high chance of defeating
 a poor-condition D.
 If the conditions are right, A, B, and C
 all have the potential to defeat D.
 But in your case, you're assuming
 the enemy is always at their best.
 You always assume the worst-case scenario.
 Even when facing enemies with equal strength,
 you worry about how strong they are,
 or what they might do to you.
 If we're talking about a stronger
 enemy, there's no question...
 You don't bother to think of how you could win.
 Running is your only option.
 That's how losers think.
 Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself
 to face enemies stronger than
 you will take determination.
 If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,
 you must leave Gon's side.
 Okay! I'm gonna win this time!
 Let's go.
 Yeah.
 Killua's overly cautious style is the
 product of a smothering love.
 A twisted, self-serving love...
 That just makes his habits stronger,
 deeper, and harder to break.
 Without extraordinary willpower,
 this curse cannot be broken.
 I don't know who will emerge victorious...
 All right, then...
 Time to run for it.
 The loser...
 Hands his token to the winner.
 Gon and Knuckle.
 Killua and Shoot.
 Their final battle begins.

 Interest x And x Curse
 As they prepare to challenge Knuckle and Shoot,
 Gon and Killua are deep in thought.
 The loser...
 Hands his token to the winner.
 Gon...
 As promised,
 I'm coming at you
 at full power!
 If it's a speed contest, he can toy with me.
 I have to be ready to take the hit...
 And counterattack!
 Don't follow him by sight.
 Sense his motions...
 Through my aura!
 A little late, but I sensed his approach!
 But what's going on?
 I feel power rushing through my body...
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Wh-What is this thing?
 I let you borrow
 some of my aura.
 You let me borrow your aura?
 By the way, I charge ten percent interest.
 Ten percent
 every ten seconds!
 If you don't repay the debt, you'll bust.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 I call this ability ""Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.""
 I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
 I Alone Lose When It Reaches the Heavens
 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
 That's the mascot, Amortizing Power Redirector.
 Attacking APR is a waste of time...
 It'll just hang around you,
 telling you when your interest goes up.
 It's both harmless and invincible.
 Though it can be an eyesore...
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Again.
 It doesn't hurt at all...
 Instead, I feel another power rush.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 It suddenly almost doubled?!
 That's because I just lent you
 another 180 aura.
 180 aura?
 What do these numbers mean?
 It seems you have no clue what I'm talking about.
 ""180 aura"" is a numeric measure
 of your spiritual power.
 Aura accumulates in the body,
 and your Maximum aura Output Potential (MOP)
 varies according to your training.
 Also, there is a limit on how much
 aura you're able to release at once,
 which can be raised through training.
 In other words,
 Present aura Output Potential [POP]
 your POP, the latent aura inside you, doesn't matter.
 If you haven't trained to increase your AOP,
 Present aura Output Potential [POP]
 Actualized aura Output Potential [AOP]
 the amount of aura you can actually release,
 1000 aura                                      200 aura
 you'll be at a huge disadvantage. Get it, fool?
 When you use Ken, you can sustain
 a maximum 1,800 aura around your body.
 When preparing for battle,
 you usually expend 1 aura per second.
 However, once the fight begins,
 you begin to use advanced techniques such as Gyo, Ryu, and Ken,
 which require considerable Nen.
 This increases the rate you expend
 aura by six to ten times.
 The stronger your techniques,
 the more aura you use up.
 Got that, fool?
 Your control is still weak,
 so you're burning 10 aura every second.
 That's 600 aura you expend per minute in battle.
 In yesterday's fight, you ran
 out after twenty minutes...
 So, in a regular fight, you used up 12,000 aura.
 Then add your four Jajankens!
 Your AOP is around 1,800 aura.
 But at the moment you called out ""Jan""
 to activate Jajanken, the aura focused
 in your fist was over 2,000.
 That's due to its long charge and your defensive
 sacrifice, done to focus aura in your fist.
 A special provision covers such risks
 attributed to special attacks.
 You expended around 5,500 aura
 with the first three Jajanken shots!
 That puts your total consumed aura at 17,500.
 As for the fourth shot...
 Right before your do over hit, you ran out of energy.
 Assuming that you needed twice the
 usual aura amount to complete the attack,
 the fourth shot required 4,000 aura.
 The amount of aura used up is
 the same for Rock and Paper.
 However, Paper falls within a different category,
 and you haven't practiced much,
 so you used up 4,000 aura on a weak attack.
 That probably only had the strength
 of about a 500-aura attack.
 Thus, your maximum POP
 is around 21,500 aura!
 I wasn't expecting this kind of attack...
 Looks like you're not good at math.
 But I'm just getting started!
 Listen up, fool!
 When your borrowed aura, including interest,
 surpasses your current remaining POP,
 you'll bust.
 Aura works like a bank account balance.
 If you keep spending, your balance decreases...
 But the interest keeps skyrocketing!
 It's been a few minutes since we started.
 You've used up at least 2,000.
 Take a look.
 It's huge!
 That's not all...
 It's three times what it was before?
 That can't be right!
 It's only been two or three minutes!
 To be precise, it's been 120 seconds.
 This exemplifies how interest
 can snowball on you.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Even after adding in the
 390 aura I've lent you, you're under 20,000.
 Your debt will continue to grow.
 Even if you stand perfectly still,
 in 260 seconds, or 4 minutes and 20 seconds,
 you'll bust.
 Bankrupt
 What happens if I bust?
 APR will become the
 Individual Ren Suppressor,
 and spend thirty days tracking the target.
 During that time, the target will
 remain in a state of Zetsu.
 Basically, unable to use any Nen.
 It's too late to regret fighting me now, fool!
 That's why he didn't use this ability earlier.
 He held back for my sake...
 Knuckle!
 Thank you.
 Here I come!
 That punch just now was around 150...
 You returned 150 to me,
 but I lent you another 180.
 The net impact is that your
 loan increases by 30...
 What will you do now?
 Until your debt is repaid,
 I won't take damage from your attacks.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Yeah, come at me, fool!
 If you just stand around, you'll bust
 after the four minutes expire!
 You managed to land more hits.
 But ultimately, you only returned about 100.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 That's just a drop in the bucket.
 You repaid less than half your
 last interest payment...
 I won't let you launch Jajanken again.
 Once your debt passes 10,000,
 my victory is assured.
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Wh-What is that?
 Can't let him intimidate me.
 Neither of us knows anything
 about the other's abilities!
 I don't like hurting other people.
 That's why I chose a power that only activates
 when I must hurt someone.
 To give myself a weapon that only works
 against those I have no qualms about hurting.
 However...
 You boys have taught me
 that a worthy opponent deserves my full strength.
 Three hands?
 How?
 They're floating?!
 What kind of power is this?
 Should I attack first?
 Stay calm...
 Observe the situation with Gyo!
 He's not using In.
 There are three floating hands.
 That means,
 most likely, he's a Manipulator.
 That cage is also a mystery.
 He doesn't need it if he plans to use
 those flying hands to attack.
 In other words...
 Touching those hands is dangerous!
 Yo-yos, huh?
 Let's see what you can do.
 He's amazingly adept...
 He's fast!
 Those hands were just a distraction?
 Jump back.
 When facing an enemy you
 believe to be stronger,
 you fight on the premise of escaping.
 No way...
 That's no different from what I've always done.
 Use electricity!
 Couldn't get the attack off!
 My body won't listen to me...
 This...
 is my curse.
 His reaction was slow.
 Is something wrong?
 Stop... Don't think about it.
 It's my bad habit.
 His circumstances don't matter.
 Do my best to defeat him.
 Otherwise, I'm only insulting him!
 He's strong and fast.
 He probably has me beat in every area...
 That's right, Killua...
 That's the way.
 Don't fight an enemy you can't beat.
 I have to stop thinking that way!
 Your weakness is that you're
 too quick to give up.
 Even when facing enemies with equal strength,
 you worry about how strong they are,
 or what they might do to you.
 If we're talking about a stronger
 enemy, there's no question...
 You don't bother to think of how you could win.
 Running is your only option.
 That's how losers think.
 I realize that this isn't your fault.
 It's the fault of whoever taught you to fight.
 Habits that are burned into your
 body and soul aren't easy to break.
 Somewhere down the line,
 you'll leave Gon behind to die.
 Forget it.
 You can't win.
 My left eye?
 The left side of my face
 is gone...
 That was a much better reaction.
 Was what happened earlier a fluke?
 If you take damage without knowing why,
 get as far from the enemy as you can.
 My curse saved me.
 But that isn't good enough!
 Suppressing that bad habit and forcing yourself
 to face enemies stronger than
 you will take determination.
 I must fight to win!
 I'm blind on the left side...
 There it was again.
 You reacted quickly.
 No! I'm just running away!
 I haven't been fighting at all...
 If you can't defeat Shoot tomorrow,
 you must leave Gon's side!
 I'm done running away.

 It looks grim...
 She's in very bad shape.
 Multiple organs have been crushed
 so badly, we cannot heal them!
 If something isn't done...
 Neferpitou-dono!
 The Queen is dying...
 We require your assistance!
 We need the power you
 used to heal that man!
 I only healed him because I need him.
 Now that the King has been born,
 she means nothing to the Royal Guard.
 She is no longer necessary.
 Your Majesty!
 Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
 Well? Will Neferpitou-dono help us?
 No, Neferpitou-dono has...
 No...
 They have all abandoned the Queen.
 Abandoned?
 We'll have to save the Queen ourselves!
 It's impossible!
 Weren't you listening to me?
 We don't have the power
 to heal the damage the Queen has suffered...
 Perhaps they have the power we need.
 Who are you talking about?
 Hey, where are you going?
 We have prepared your dinner on the roof,
 where there is a fine view.
 Then, it would seem faster
 to get there from outside.
 Magnificent...
 Excuse me.
 That looks fun...
 It seems I need practice.
 Disgusting.
 You don't like it?
 It is horrendously bland.
 We haven't been seasoning our food...
 No, that is not what I mean.
 When I was in her belly,
 I was occasionally treated to
 wonderfully rich, savory meals.
 Ah, you must be talking
 about the rare humans.
 My body longs for that
 indescribable satisfaction.
 I wish to feast upon one of them.
 As you wish.
 In that case...
 One of them is heading straight for us.
 Have we been seen?
 Let's hide...
 Wait.
 Something seems off...
 Look!
 A white flag?
 We surrender!
 We surrender!
 But there is one condition...
 You must save the Queen!
 She no longer has the ability to give birth.
 The Queen?
 The King has already been born!
 Impossible!
 It's too early!
 He is...
 They are all
 devils...
 What is this?
 They put up no fight.
 Disgusting.
 This is all wrong.
 Might I offer some advice?
 The brain is the most delicious part of a human.
 So I'd recommend dispatching your
 prey without harming the head.
 Is that so?
 Like this?
 Magnificent!
 I see... This is not so bad.
 However...
 It is still inedible,
 when compared to a rare human.
 Might I offer more advice?
 There is a way to identify rare humans.
 If you use—
 Do you insult me?
 I am aware
 that if I focus, I can see the
 energy around their bodies.
 The volume of energy reveals their strength.
 Please forgive my insolence.
 Simply finding and consuming
 them is not entertaining.
 I enjoy the moments before eating,
 before it is clear whether
 the human is rare or not.
 Since I have already alleviated my hunger.
 Incidentally, Pitou...
 You are quite strong.
 I was trying to kill you.
 You have earned my respect.
 I am unworthy.
 I don't believe it...
 He ate a soldier... One of his own.
 That isn't entirely correct.
 He is a completely different organism.
 I imagine he views all other creatures as food.
 So what should we do now?
 What do you mean?
 If the Queen dies, we'll lose
 our reason to stay here.
 Haven't we already lost our reason to stay?
 The Queen can no longer reproduce.
 Huh?
 That's true.
 It's no longer possible for the
 Queen to build her kingdom.
 In that case, each of us should
 try to become a king...
 We can do as we please.
 Do you realize what you're saying?
 You think you can get away with this?
 I'm sure we aren't the only ones
 who'd like to leave this place.
 W-Wait...
 Now do you see that you're in the minority?
 Please... There's no time!
 If the Queen dies,
 there will be nothing to hold
 the Squadron Leaders back.
 Things will spin out of control.
 What exactly will happen then?
 Most likely, they will imitate the King.
 They will leave to build their own
 kingdoms by spreading their seed.
 If the chain of command collapses,
 some of the Captains will also strike out alone.
 They will scatter throughout the world
 and destroy entire ecosystems.
 Are Chimera Ant soldiers
 capable of reproduction?
 Yes...
 They can copulate with females
 of other species and reproduce.
 Soldiers belonging to a colony led by a queen
 will not attempt to reproduce.
 But I've read reports
 of soldiers attempting to reproduce
 following a queen's death.
 Well, I'd say we can safely assume he isn't lying.
 What's your name?
 Colt.
 Colt, we're going to take you to our boss.
 I need you to tell your story to him directly.
 However,
 I don't know if he will trust you.
 And even if he believes your story,
 he may not let you leave alive.
 Are you still willing to come with us?
 Absolutely! Time is of the essence!
 The timing couldn't be worse.
 Today is the day our disciples fight it out...
 Oh! I completely forgot...
 I bet 100,000 that Knuckle
 and Shoot would make it.
 You bet 1,000,000 that all five would come...
 Knuckle...
 Huh?
 Promise me!
 You have to...
 You have to save Kite!
 Got it...
 I promise I'll bring him back.
 Rook
 I swear on this token.
 Killua...
 I'm weak...
 I never knew...
 I never knew
 how frustrating
 weakness could be!
 Gon...
 For the thirty days that you can't use Nen...
 I'll protect you.
 I will do whatever it takes!
 After that,
 it's goodbye.

 One Wish x And x Two Promises
 Colt arrived, under a white flag of
 surrender, to ask the Hunters a favor.
 His wish was that they save the dying Queen.
 After hearing his request, Morel and
 Knov took Colt to see Netero.
 It's me.
 Send over a team of Chimera Ant
 researchers immediately.
 Hmm?
 The king has been born.
 Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School,
 and have him bring all
 his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts.
 We leave in four hours.
 Yes, sir.
 We will do everything we can.
 Colt-kun...
 We'll need your cooperation.
 Heart
 This may be the last time I wear this...
 Hey, is that...
 Yes, it's his ""heart"" T-shirt.
 Heart
 They say it's a lucky shirt he only
 wears when he fights for real.
 But I always thought it was a just a rumor...
 Colt-kun, it appears that you can use Nen...
 Since you've been in the King's presence,
 I want you to give me your honest opinion.
 How do I compare to the King?
 He really is special...
 It feels like needles pricking
 me all over my body.
 Most likely,
 you will be unable to lay a finger on him.
 You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard
 before you can get close enough.
 I see...
 I'm happy to hear that.
 At this age, I'll be a challenger.
 This is exciting stuff.
 Morel, I believe your disciples
 were to fight today, yes?
 Yes.
 Take the victors and the research team,
 along with Colt, to the nest.
 And you, Chairman?
 You don't plan to pursue the King alone?
 Oh, no...
 I'm off to see an old acquaintance.
 Don't forget to pay me my one million.
 I know.
 What are you talking about?
 Nothing important.
 Let's go.
 Yeah.
 Everyone else has left.
 Most of our soldiers joined
 other squadrons and left.
 Though a few oddballs did leave
 their squadrons to stay here.
 I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out.
 Did you stop the bleeding?
 Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her.
 I'm not sure we can, either.
 Don't expect too much.
 For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs.
 Can you use my organs?
 You can have all my blood, as well!
 Unfortunately, it won't work.
 Chimera Ants from different generations
 are completely different organisms.
 Just look at how much the Chimera
 Ants in your own generation vary.
 But the sentiment is appreciated.
 We'll do our best, so pray...
 That, miraculously, all the organs will function.
 Pray...
 Is that all I can do?
 Someone...
 Is anyone there?
 Yes, I am by your side!
 Please give me your command!
 What is it?
 Telepathy?
 Yes,
 the Queen cannot speak as we do.
 Can you tell us what she's saying?
 Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life.
 My son...
 Is my son all right?
 Did he have any defects?
 ...defects?
 You have nothing to worry about.
 He is perfectly healthy, and right now...
 And right now, he's taken
 the Royal Guard to search
 for medicine to help you.
 ...to help you.
 The truth is that, after he killed
 and ate Squadron Leaders,
 he left in search of a new territory.
 I doubt he will return.
 He ate them?
 The King
 has no concern for the Queen's health!
 Then, the King is safe?
 Yes.
 That is wonderful...
 Oh, no.
 Send the King off at once.
 There is no time to waste on my well-being...
 My son has the potential to rule the world.
 He was born too early,
 so I was very worried.
 However, it appears...
 I have fulfilled my duty...
 That was all I wanted.
 What are you saying?!
 You are our guiding light...
 Without you, the rest of us will
 lose our way and perish.
 I know my body better than anyone else...
 I will not last much longer.
 However, I have
 no regrets.
 Please stop!
 I beg you... Please live!
 Use my body! Please!
 Give it a shot!
 Until you try, you don't know it won't work!
 Listen...
 You must listen to what the Queen has to say.
 I have one last request...
 I thought of a name...
 for my son.
 For the King...
 A name?
 Meruem.
 It means the light that illuminates all.
 Deliver my message to him...
 My beloved son...
 I failed to protect her again...
 I can't protect anyone...
 Has something like this happened before?
 No, he's probably referring to a memory
 from when he was human.
 You have memories from
 when you were human?
 Of course, though naturally, some
 remember more than others...
 Our human personalities
 strongly influence our current behavior.
 And many can remember their human names.
 Otherwise, it wouldn't have been
 as easy to learn to speak.
 Hmm?
 Th-This is...
 There's...
 There's something moving!
 Don't touch it!
 I will...
 I will remove it.
 I shall protect this child...
 I swear it!
 This time, I won't fail...
 Morel?
 Colt...
 Can you promise me
 that you and that child
 will never eat humans?
 If you can't make that promise,
 you should get out of my sight immediately.
 But if you're willing to give your word...
 No one will ever lay a finger on you,
 not as long as I'm around.
 You have my promise!
 It isn't a big deal...
 I inherited my soft nature from my master.
 Okay, I've recovered!
 Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite.
 So I have to become stronger!
 So that Kite won't be disappointed
 when he comes back.
 Ah, so you do understand.
 You may have met Kite before we did,
 but we've spent more time with him.
 After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still
 been moping, I would've given you a beating...
 And told you that Kite wouldn't
 want to see you two like this.
 I know he's still alive,
 and he doesn't want you to have regrets.
 Right now, what should you do?
 You must make the correct decision,
 and find the will to follow through!
 If you're too weak, train more.
 There's enough space here
 for squats and push-ups.
 Yeah, you're right.
 Hey, Spin...
 Hmm?
 Why do you want to be a Hunter?
 I need the money to repay a huge debt.
 Have you heard of the small-billed swan?
 Nope...
 It's a species of bird that can only live
 in the area around a certain mine.
 No one knows why that is.
 Is it the water? The food? The weather?
 So I bought the entire area where the mine is.
 Well, the mine's closed down now.
 Kite provided the money for that.
 He was the first adult who was willing to listen
 to kids who had nothing at all.
 Stinn and I were born in that area.
 The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking
 flight with the light of dawn at their backs...
 That's the oldest, but strongest,
 memory Stinn and I have.
 When we heard the area would be demolished,
 we realized how important it was to us...
 Kite said that he envied us.
 He doesn't have a home.
 Because he doesn't know where he was born.
 Once this mission is over,
 I can show you two
 my treasure.
 Th-This is...
 Goal!
 I am the Speed King.
 No one can stop me!
 Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably
 already crossed the border.
 Well, I'll take my time searching...
 For my own paradise,
 with plenty of food and females.
 Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears...
 I'll take any of those if they're plentiful.
 Because I am the Glutton King.
 The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers
 have now departed to become kings.
 Meanwhile, the King
 is now in the Republic of East Gorteau.
 Next time: Date x With x Palm.
 A date! A date!
 Gon, do you understand what a date is?
 Huh? Sure.
 It's when a man and womanâ€”

 I'm busy right now.
 Don't bother me with reports
 I don't need to hear!
 Carry on now.
 Date x With x Palm
 I don't know which nation sent you.
 But having entered this palace,
 you must now die painful deaths.
 Your Majesty...
 I needn't even strain my eyes to sense it.
 This is a rare human.
 An appetizing treat.
 This is it...
 This is the flavor I sought!
 I feel it.
 I feel it! I feel it!
 This is it!
 I can feel power surging through my body!
 Nyow I understand...
 This is the King's power.
 He can take aura from rare humans he consumes.
 In other words,
 the more he eats, the stronger he will grow.
 Hmm? Who are you people?
 Guards!
 What are you incompetents doing?
 Worthless.
 I can't sense anything.
 Insolent thugs!
 Do you know who I am?
 A supreme leader of this era,
 a king among kings...
 I am Masador Diego!
 Why does that scum claim to be the king?
 In the human world, it is a common phenomenon.
 Humans without intelligence or talent
 end up in positions of power due
 to bloodline or connections.
 That defies all logic...
 In the hands of an incompetent,
 power brings nothing but ruin.
 This could only be the work of imbeciles.
 We must provide proper guidance.
 Absolutely.
 However, they serve as quality meat,
 and they are a self-renewing resource.
 They are an easy food source.
 The non-rare humans can be
 used to feed our soldiers.
 I shall use my godly power
 to deal divine punishment!
 Leave at once—
 Allow me to dispose of this.
 I can use it to control other humans.
 Do as you like.
 P-Please!
 S-Spare our lives.
 We beg you...
 These humans are idiots.
 Think as hard as those weak
 brains of yours can manage.
 Have you ever spared a pig or a cow
 as it begged for its life?
 The view is excellent.
 And there is plenty of space.
 I dub this place the Meat Plantation.
 It will be used for processing humans.
 As you command.
 After being defeated by Knuckle
 and Shoot, Gon and Killua
 return to the inn where Palm waits.
 Before I worry about enemies,
 I have to protect Gon from Palm.
 You must take responsibility.
 What?!
 You promised to take me to NGL...
 You said you'd swallow a thousand needles
 if you broke that promise.
 Uh-huh, I'm sorry.
 I don't want an apology...
 But there's no point in having you
 swallow a thousand needles.
 Yeah.
 So what can I do to make up for it?
 Let's see...
 You must...
 do any one thing I say.
 Hey!
 Right now, do you know how Gon feels—
 Okay, I agree!
 Go out with me.
 Go out with me...
 Eh?
 Okay.
 Huh?
 Do you have any idea what you're doing?!
 Yeah, but I did say I'd do anything.
 And you have no problem
 playing dirty like this?!
 This is none of your business.
 It's our problem.
 It's up to the two of us.
 You should stay away from her, Gon.
 Don't interrupt us!
 This is something the two
 of us must decide alone.
 You just want an excuse to say that!
 Just be quiet.
 We're going out now...
 There's somewhere I really want to go.
 Oh, sorry. I can't go out today.
 Eh?
 Today, I have to train with Killua.
 I know!
 You can train with us, Palm!
 Huh?
 What are you talking about?
 Didn't you say we'd go out?
 Uh-huh.
 Then, why is he tagging along?
 And why would we train?
 Are you toying with me?
 This will be a date...
 Our first date!
 The first date for us!
 The! First! Date!
 But it isn't a date.
 Huh?!
 We can have a proper date later.
 Since it's our first date, like you said.
 Wow...
 The word ""date"" keeps popping up.
 And I need time to prepare for it, too.
 Prepare? Prepare for what?
 That's...
 a secret.
 You get to find out tomorrow.
 Oh...
 In that case,
 it's fine.
 Really...
 If you'd explained first,
 I wouldn't have been so angry.
 Sorry about that.
 But I wanted to keep it secret, to surprise you!
 You wanted to surprise me?
 Gosh...
 Let's meet tomorrow, at 10 AM,
 in front of the bulletin board.
 I'll be there!
 Gon, you're amazing!
 Huh? What do you mean?
 Well, listening to you talk to Palm,
 you seemed used to this stuff.
 Really?
 I was wondering...
 Hmm?
 Have you been on a date before?
 Sure, I have.
 Well, most of them were with Mito-san.
 Oh, that makes sense...
 Wait, who else was there?
 Oh, some of the fishing boats
 that stopped at Whale Island were full of women,
 some of whom only liked younger men...
 So I took them around the village
 and had them teach me things.
 T-Teach him things?
 Th-That means...
 He's a grown-up!
 Women like that were called fanatics.
 Haven't you ever been on a date, Killua?
 No! Of course not...
 I spent all my time training as an assassin.
 And ever since I quit, I've been with you.
 Oh, yeah.
 Right!
 And I really don't want that to change...
 Somewhere down the line,
 you'll leave Gon behind to die.
 Damn, I'm about ready to give in...
 And this was my own decision...
 Hello?
 It's Knuckle.
 We've located and secured Kite.
 Really? Kite's okay?
 Knuckle?
 I believe that Kite's being controlled by the enemy.
 So I wouldn't say that he's okay.
 That's fine.
 There must be a way to bring him back!
 All right, it'll take three days to get back,
 so watch out for any soldier ants.
 It seems they've scattered far
 and wide, imitating the king.
 Got it.
 Yes!
 I knew that Kite was alive!
 That's great.
 All that's left
 is to protect you for a month.
 Wow!
 Look over here!
 I've found a new feeding ground.
 There we go.
 What's that for?
 It's a present for Palm.
 Are you sure about this?
 If you hand that to her, won't she freak out?
 If I just hand it to her, probably...
 Whatever... Let's get back to town.
 Yeah.
 If we encounter soldier ants
 here, in the mountains,
 we'll be in serious trouble.
 Likewise, if we stay in town, the risk of
 encountering ants looking for humans is high.
 But while other humans are being
 targeted, we can escape.
 After all, Gon can't currently use his Nen...
 So I must protect him.
 Even if it means sacrificing everything else!
 Let's hurry.
 Drop your weapon,
 place your hands behind your head,
 and lie down on the ground!
 If you don't comply within three
 seconds, we will open fire.
 Three...
 Two...
 One!
 Ready...
 Fire!
 He disappeared?
 Ow!
 These guys are so slow...
 This is no fun.
 On to the next story.
 Today, around noon,
 an unidentified creature killed
 seven people in Pata City.
 The creature also injured multiple police
 officers who had rushed to the scene,
 before escaping into the Miera Mountains.
 According to police testimony,
 the creature moved at speeds exceeding
 two hundred kilometers per hour.
 Before leaving, it said, ""I'll return
 tomorrow. Bring faster humans,""
 which means it could be a new
 species of Magical Beast.
 An evacuation has been ordered
 for all area residents.

 The government has requested that

 and the Association has accepted.
 Next, we have the weather.
 I'm done, Killua!
 Tomorrow, we're both on our own.
 Yeah, I'll be training all day in the gym.
 Yeah, right.
 I can't ditch Gon when he's
 essentially defenseless...
 Gon-kun, over here.
 Hmm?
 I didn't recognize you!
 Who are you?!
 Do I look strange?
 Nope, you look really pretty!
 Wait, stop it... You're too loud.
 You're embarrassing me...
 What? I'm just telling the truth.
 That's enough. Let's go.
 Quickly.
 Damn...
 What am I doing?
 Now I look like the stalker!
 No, don't let it get to me.
 I have to protect Gon!
 There's no telling when
 the enemy will show up.
 How far are they going to go?
 Something's there.
 This aura is probably from a soldier ant.
 It isn't that close,
 but it isn't that far, either.
 There are faint aura traces around.
 Did it already pass through the area?
 Or were they brought here by the wind?
 Either way, there's a high
 risk our paths will cross!
 Should I warn them?
 We're here.
 Eh?
 It's beautiful...
 No,
 there's no point in telling them.
 Gon can't use his Nen.
 If he gets upset about Kite and flies
 off the handle with rage, he's finished.
 Knowing Palm, she'll definitely
 go nuts if I interrupt her date.
 If she breaks the silence with her shrieks,
 Use this chair.
 the nearby ants will notice us.
 Thank you, I'm fine.
 I can't let them know...
 I'll take care of this myself!
 Oh, I thought I smelled a human...
 That's...
 I remember you.
 You're one of those kids from before!
 Looks like your luck's run out.
 You're about to get a taste of hell.
 But it won't last forever.
 I moved upwind to catch his attention
 and draw him away from them.
 I've done what I had to.
 But...
 Where's the other kid?
 Once you tell me his location,
 I'll give you an easy death.
 Well, he can't be that far away...
 He's your buddy, right?
 Well, it doesn't matter if you talk or not.
 I'll just walk around making lots of noise
 and swinging your severed head.
 Then he'll come to me himself.
 Isn't that how humans are?
 He's right.
 I have to defeat him,
 or it's all over!
 I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!

 Determined to protect Gon
 for the thirty days he can't use Nen,
 Killua prepares for a fight with a Chimera Ant.
 However...
 Run.
 Yes! That's more like it!
 That terrified expression...
 I love it!
 Damn, I'm getting excited now...
 I'm gonna tear you apart.
 If you aren't certain you can win, run.
 I have to protect him... I have to...
 When you know nothing of your opponent...
 ...protect Gon.
 ...run away.
 No matter what!
 Is there something special about that tree?
 Just wait a little longer.
 Amazing...
 They're seaside fireflies.
 They're only found around brackish water,
 and this is their breeding season.
 It's beautiful!
 Isn't it?
 You piss yourself or something?
 Well?!
 Can't even move a muscle?
 Lose your spine?
 Damn, this feels so good...
 Should I kill him?
 Ah, but I want to enjoy this!
 Here.
 It's a present.
 This is the most beautiful flower in the world.
 It is?
 Stay still.
 The tree's sap is very similar to
 the pheromones fireflies emit,
 so they tend to gather around branches.
 I'm so happy...
 Thank you.
 Really?
 I'm glad to hear that.
 But I...
 I can't give you what you truly want.
 What I truly want?
 Time alone with me.
 Eh?
 I...
 I want to become stronger.
 Strong enough to defeat the Chimera Ants.
 That means I have to train harder.
 In two days, Kite's coming back.
 But it sounds like he's under enemy control.
 To return him to normal, I'll probably
 have to fight whoever is controlling him.
 So until Kite is back to normal...
 Or if possible, until the
 Chimera Ants are defeated...
 I want to focus on my training.
 Yes... Yes!
 Are you okay with that?
 Huh?
 What was that?
 Damn! I can't get enough!
 Run...
 Hurry.
 No...
 Gon!
 I will...
 ...protect you.
 Because
 we're friends...
 You're my dear friend!

 I'll kill you! I'll kill you...

 Shut up!
 I'll leave the head, but eat the rest!
 Run.
 I don't want
 to lose him!
 Run.
 Gon is...
 Run.
 ...my...
 Run.
 ...dear...
 Run.
 It has to be Killua.
 My very dear friend!
 He disappeared?
 He fooled me good.
 Illumi must have planted this
 inside my head.
 Huh? What are you talking about?
 Have you lost your mind?
 And how did you dodge that?
 Wait, I saw the whole thing.
 Right before I reached him,
 he jammed his finger into his own head.
 And then he vanished,
 before popping up over there.
 Yeah, I feel so much better now.
 I'm completely awake now.
 Or maybe I should say I'm liberated.
 That's all that happened! Nothing more...
 This can't be happening!
 Now I'm the one who's afraid?!
 I have a message for the other Ants.
 If you come anywhere near us,
 your lives are over.
 That's bull!
 Very well.
 Then don't bother.
 They're gone.
 Their stuff's still here...
 Were other Ants nearby?
 I don't sense any.
 That means...
 What are you doing?!
 Eh? Can't you tell?
 I'm punishing him.
 Punishing him for toying with my feelings!
 What the hell?
 You're the one who's being unreasonable!
 Well, at least he's okay...
 Leave us alone!
 This is none of your business!
 Right back at you, stupid.
 Why don't you make yourself scarce?
 Why are you injured?
 Huh?
 Oh, I was training... Got a problem with it?
 I'll injure you some more!
 Palm...
 Don't bother.
 I could dodge your knife in my sleep.
 I was so sure he was dead...
 Wait!
 I'll kill you!
 What?
 Catch us if you can, stupid!
 Wait!
 Stop, Killua...
 You're just making her angrier.
 Huh?
 If we ditch her here, we'll never see her again.
 We just have to call Knuckle and tell
 him we'll meet him somewhere else.
 I'm going back.
 Do you want to die?
 If you let your guard down,
 thinking she's not much of a fighter,
 she'll stab you in the back!
 She wouldn't do that.
 Huh?!
 Bu— Didn't you see her take that knife to me?
 Damn, you're too much!
 They're making a fool of me!
 They think they've escaped me?
 Fools!
 Wherever you run to, I will know!
 Cute, cute mermaid...
 Where is that accursed brat, Killua?
 There he is, the fool!
 The hotel by the station...
 Brat...
 Brat! Brat! Brat!
 He keeps interfering!
 If not for him, everything would be fine.
 I'll chase him to the end of
 the world and eliminate him!
 Make a fool of me, will you?!
 Kno—
 Knov-sama...
 Where did those boys go?
 R-Right...
 They went to the hotel that
 has a logo with three circles.
 This is Knov.
 They're at the Triple Circle Hotel.
 Yeah, we just got a call from them.
 Um, I believe you had planned
 to arrive in two days...
 No, we're on schedule.
 We'll use the extra two days
 to observe those boys,
 to determine if they're ready to
 see Kite in his current state.
 But first things first, Palm!
 Y-Yes?
 It appears that you used your
 power without my permission.
 I told you to await my orders,
 in case of unforeseen events.
 Yes...
 Your blood is an irreplaceable commodity.
 Irreplaceable?
 Use it only for me.
 Only for Knov-sama...
 Understood?
 Y-Yes.
 Knov-sama really is the only one for me!
 And why are you dressed like that?
 Oh! No reason...
 N-Nothing's going on!
 Irreplaceable...
 Then tell her to wait until
 Kite's back to normal.
 I did.
 Gon Freecss, age 12, blood type B,
 forced into a relationship by Palm
 Siberia, age 22, blood type A...
 and dumped before he knew it.
 Meh... Again?
 That's the third one.
 Oh! A secret one!
 Huh? Really?
 Yeah, you can auction it on
 the net for a lot of money.
 Then you can have it.
 Not interested.
 Did something happen?
 Hmm? Not really.
 Let's hit the gym.
 Okay!
 Well?
 Oh, I haven't noticed anything.
 They seem to be doing fine...
 But we should continue to observe them.
 That will give them time to
 conclude their business.
 While Knov and Shoot were observing
 the mental state of Gon and Killua...
 He's here.
 Who's this guy?
 Not bad.
 He's fast.
 You're faster than the guys
 I fought yesterday.
 But not by much.
 Next time: Grudge x And x Dread.
 Give me more meat!
 You eat a lot.
 Bitter much?
 You mean, ""Jealous much?""

95,"Looks like you guys have been
 waiting here to kill me.
 Sorry, but the prey is about
 to become the predator.
 You'll die before you can even strike back.
 Really?
 I barely felt a thing.
 You could punch us like that a few
 thousand times without killing us.
 I get it.
 You're trying to act tough.
 You're swinging long after the ball's
 already in the catcher's mitt.
 Just as a warning, I'm not
 using my full strength.
 I can run faster and throw harder punches.
 This is a surprise.
 He's actually aiming for my face.
 I was certain his eyes couldn't
 even follow my motion earlier...
 Just a lucky guess?
 Him, too...
 He's clearly ascertaining where
 I'm going to be before he attacks.
 It's only been a minute since I encountered them.
 They've adapted to my speed that quickly?
 They're nothing like the guys from yesterday.
 How amusing...
 It makes this more of a challenge!
 Grudge x And x Dread
 Your bodies can't keep up with your minds...
 You obviously can't compete physically.
 How are you gonna compensate?
 With guns? Numbers?
 We'll use wit and experience.
 Where did this stuff come from?
 Smoke? Gas?
 Poison gas?
 Or sleeping gas?
 No, they're standing within it.
 This must be some kind of special power.
 Are you scared?
 You can retreat if you want.
 Does that mean you aren't running away?
 Then this is a smokescreen.
 They'll use it as cover for their attack.
 Well, let's see what they can do...
 Here it comes!
 What?
 When you use Gyo, your body freezes briefly.
 This trick won't work on the same
 opponent too many times.
 But it only needs to once.
 I wouldn't be so sure.
 That didn't hurt at all.
 I'll admit that you caught me off-guard,
 but you didn't do any damage.
 What's this?
 Gee, I wonder...
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 Answer me.
 Answer me!
 Your anger is blinding you
 to your surroundings...
 It'll be super easy to send you tumbling.
 Hey! Damn it!
 They're gone?
 Where are you?
 It's time.
 Adding interest.
 It doesn't matter what your power does.
 I just have to rip you apart!
 Looks like he's powerless against Zetsu.
 Well, we're dealing with
 a level-one soldier ant.
 With APR on him, we can easily track him.
 We just need to chase him down,
 box him in, and that'll be the end.
 But doesn't your ability lose its effect
 if the target moves too far away?
 It'll stop adding interest,
 but the effect will remain.
 Once I'm back in range,
 the counter will start up again.
 But even if IRS doesn't kick in,
 he'll be easy to finish off.
 We've already learned his attacks.
 You fool!
 We may know what pitch he'll use,
 but we still can't put the bat on the ball.
 Let's leave him for a Nen user who's
 better equipped to handle him.
 You're right.
 I'm more concerned about Gon and Killua...
 Damn...
 I can't shake this thing.
 I can't outrun it...
 So this is Nen.
 I need more than just speed here.
 Kite's in here.
 He is no longer the person you once knew.
 It's okay.
 We'll find a way to cure him!
 Hotel Rafflesia...
 Hotel Rafflesia:
 Dark Inn
 Once I've dealt an enemy a
 certain amount of damage,
 I'm able to trap
 an entire body or merely a single part inside.
 This must be how he took my eye.
 If I release him from the cage,
 he'll return to his original size.
 Be careful.
 He cannot use Nen, but he is still strong.
 Kite...
 Most likely, they used him to train soldiers.
 He automatically attacks
 anyone who approaches.
 Kite...
 It's okay now.
 It's okay.
 It's been a while...
 since you punched me.
 That hurt a lot...
 You're going to let this beating continue?
 Gon can't use Nen to defend himself either, right?
 It's okay, Gon will notice.
 Maybe he already has,
 and is still...
 Perhaps.
 He's suppressing his reflexes to dodge or block,
 allowing himself to be hit.
 For real?
 Kite's attacks may be robotic
 and easy to anticipate.
 But Gon shouldn't be able to adapt
 so quickly in his current state!
 I'm sure he doesn't know what else to do.
 This is the reality we've created
 that we must now face.
 He'll go right next.
 Right again.
 And then left.
 Then a feint...
 He really does fight like a robot.
 Kite isn't this weak...
 Kite's punches
 hurt much more!
 I'm sorry, Kite.
 It's our fault you're like this...
 Get some rest.
 We'll take it from here.
 Level two...
 Gon can't see that thing,
 but it activates when anyone touches Kite.
 You must be highly skilled at
 combat to clear this test.
 I've already blocked Kite's Nen,
 so that belongs to whoever's controlling him.
 Be careful.
 If you touch him again, he'll attack.
 What do I do?
 How did you stop him?
 We injured him badly.
 We had no choice, but I'm still sorry.
 If you stay away, he won't attack.
 Kite...
 Just wait a little longer.
 I'll get you back to normal soon.
 Killua...
 I want that one myself!
 Killua...
 I knew something was different when I saw you.
 What did you guys do in the
 short time since I saw you last?
 We didn't do anything.
 Our enemies did.
 A Few Weeks Later
 Twenty-nine days have passed
 since Gon lost his Nen.
 Are you sure we should let them come along?
 We'll be breaking our promise to the old man.
 I see no problem with that.
 The test was to determine
 who would enter NGL...
 And we are headed to the
 Republic of East Gorteau.
 Sounds like a technicality to me.
 Then you think we shouldn't bring them with us?
 No, they're grown tigers now.
 They can take care of themselves.
 I would agree that Killua is capable,
 but what about Gon?
 At the very end, I was impressed
 by the way he moved.
 But he hasn't shown any fire since.
 And he clearly isn't focused during training.
 I believe his performance is quite inconsistent.
 But he's consistently inconsistent.
 He only gets serious when he absolutely must.
 I think his lack of drive these past few
 weeks will actually give him a boost.
 A boost?
 He's been saving up all that energy...
 To unleash when he finds his hated foe.
 Well, we'll see soon enough.
 Tomorrow, Gon's Nen will return...
 And the enemy is before us!
 Near the Republic of East Gorteau Border
 What is the agenda behind
 the sudden flurry of activity
 recently observed in East Gorteau?
 Supreme Leader Diego has personally invited
 all citizens to gather in the capital city,
 Peijing, to celebrate the
 nation's birth in ten days.
 Yes, there have been occasions
 in the past during which
 all citizens were invited to participate.
 However, we've never seen
 anything on this scale,
 where practically every citizen,
 from babies to the ill, has been summoned
 for a celebration spanning three days.
 The logical conclusion would be that
 the goal this time is different.
 What do you believe the goal to be?
 Well, it would send a powerful message
 if he were to announce his successor
 and abdication simultaneously.
 But I find it hard to imagine the Supreme
 Leader relinquishing his power.
 It may also be meant to distract
 from some other matter.
 In any event, the whole world will be
 watching East Gorteau in ten days.
 Next...
 Colt believes the celebration
 will be used as a screening.
 We don't know what they'll do
 with those found to have Nen,
 but ninety-nine percent of
 the humans there will die.
 We must stop it before that happens!
 Our time limit is ten days.
 What's the old man up to?
 He sent an e-mail saying that he's
 already inside East Gorteau,
 but I haven't heard from him since.
 Do you think he's been taken out?
 If he fails to contact us today,
 we've been told to assume as much.
 Speak of the devil, it's the Chairman.
 That old man's got some sharp ears...
 He already knows everything.
 Including the fact that you boys are here.
 And that Morel-san is badmouthing him.
 Divide into three pairs and draw the
 Royal Guard away from the King.
 The night before the celebration,
 the operation will begin at midnight.
 From the sharp-eared old man.
 That guy really scares me...
 I'm sorry to say that your thirty days are up.
 So I'll make myself scarce!
 See you around...
 Bye!
 Okay, now you can use Nen again.
 Give it a try.
 Gon...
 Sorry, but I'm still not convinced
 we should keep you around.
 Show me your resolve.
 Attack me as if I were responsible for Kite.
 If your attack is too weak, we'll replace
 you with another Hunter.
 Seriously, the master can be so difficult.
 He already agreed to bring Gon along...
 Gon, show him your Jajanken.
 You want me to attack you for real?
 Don't insult me!
 If you hold back in the slightest,
 you're off the team!
 Got it.
 First comes rock...
 Gon,
 that's enough...
 Right, big guy?
 Y-Yeah...
 Oh.
 K-Killua, thank you.
 Sorry about that, Morel-san!
 I was really about to kill you!
 You got me... You got me good.
 You go crazy with the best of them.
 We'll split up now.
 Use whatever means you deem
 best to fulfill your mission.
 Gon and Killua, as you requested,
 you're assigned to Neferpitou.
 Knuckle and Shoot, you're on the
 one called Menthuthuyoupi.
 Knov and I will take Shaiapouf.
 Best of luck to you.
 The preparations for the final
 battles are complete.
 Ten days remain until that moment.
 Next time: A x Lawless x Home.
 Wanna see what being controlled is like?
 Huh?
 Stick this antenna here...
 Huh?
 It has to be Killua.

96,"Next is the continuation of
 our report on the UMAs,
 or Unidentified Mysterious Animals,
 that have recently been sighted.
 The difference between this and our previous
 report is the increasing number of victims,
 and the amount of evidence supporting
 the existence of these creatures.
 In any case, many of the witnesses are
 active members of the police force.
 And over half of the officers
 who have rushed to the scenes have
 been killed by these creatures.
 These are images of unidentified creatures
 that have been attacking the police.
 You can see the victims on the
 ground at the creatures' feet.
 What we know is that all these creatures
 are violent, capable of speech,
 and show no fear of humans.
 A prime example is this interview
 with the lion man of Nevaska.
 He spoke at length of a crude theory
 about the existence of a kingdom.
 The woman interviewing him listened
 patiently to what he had to say,
 but eventually, she asked the
 question on every viewer's mind.
 Can you prove that you
 truly are what you claim?
 Those were her last words.
 So far, the unidentified creatures
 have only appeared on the Yorbian continent.
 But it seems likely that they
 will continue to spread,
 and no effective method of dealing
 with them has been found.
 Sorry for the wait.
 Okay, let's go.
 A x Lawless x Home
 They're known as Chimera Ants.
 I know.
 They became that way after mixing with humans.
 Working backwards from the dates and
 locations of sightings and police reports,
 they probably originated in the Balsa Islands.
 Lots of strange nations are in that area.
 You shouldn't be talking about
 how strange other people are.
 But they were once ants...
 So they should just stay close to their nest.
 Why come all the way out here?
 No idea.
 Maybe they were just wandering, or perhaps
 they were drawn to the smell of garbage.
 It can't be a coincidence.
 Both NGL and East Gorteau are nations
 that share no information with the outside world.
 Just like this place.
 That makes it easier for them to invade.
 It's been quite a long time.
 The place hasn't changed...
 What's the situation?
 Between the victims and martyrs,
 we're seeing over three hundred dead.
 Bombs have no effect, so we can't fight back.
 The council is still arguing about
 how to classify the dead.
 What do you mean?
 A few days ago, this was an ordinary human.
 The Ants did this?
 Looks dead to me.
 What's the problem?
 Some are alive and working with the Ants.
 And all of them look like monsters.
 The council's debate is whether
 to declare them dead based on
 whether or not there's a way to
 restore them to their original forms.
 They can't avenge them because
 they're too busy arguing over
 whether they're dead or mutated?
 Nothing's changed.
 They always lose sight of what's important.
 We're going to do things our way.
 If anyone interferes, we'll take them down.
 Don't worry.
 Before the day is out,
 we'll exterminate this so-called Queen.
 I am the Queen.
 I repeat.
 Surrender.
 Those who resist will be executed.
 The chosen will live in paradise for eternity!
 Our mother's greatest flaw
 was that she could only produce soldiers
 through the archaic and inefficient laying of eggs.
 Her sole achievement
 was giving birth to me.
 Stop...
 Kill me!
 Kill me!
 Plenty of spirit...
 He shows promise.
 Bingo.
 Chosen one, welcome to paradise.
 Swear eternal fealty to the Queen.
 I am the Queen.
 Sexy Stinger of Rebirth
 With my Queen Shot, I shall control the world.
 Let's go through the front door.
 No objection here...
 No one's around.
 Are they inviting us in?
 Then I'll go this way.
 I'll take this way.
 We're splitting up?
 Of course... It's a race to see
 who'll kill the Queen.
 I imagine you'd prefer to hide
 your abilities from us.
 Kill anything that attacks you.
 If you kill the Queen, you're the interim boss.
 Understood.
 Start!
 They've scattered.
 From their footsteps, I can sense
 that these intruders are special.
 They are accustomed to living in the wild.
 Are they strong?
 Yes.
 Then go and greet them.
 But then, no one will be here to guard you.
 If you're worried about me,
 capture the enemy and hurry back.
 I have faith in you, Pike.
 Y-You are too kind...
 I will serve you with my life!
 Off I go!
 Now, then...
 You're heading out?
 My mother's greatest misfortune
 was that she never experienced
 the joy of combat.
 You're no fun...
 Let me hold you.
 I'll send you to heaven.
 Moles.
 No, holes?
 Bonolenov descended from a small tribe
 that industrialization had driven out of
 its ancestral lands, the Gyudondond.
 When Gyudondond males reach the age of three,
 needles are used to puncture holes in their body.
 Depending on the holes' size and shape,
 and the movements the Gyudondond
 make, they can produce sound.
 Before fighting rival tribes or wild animals,
 they would play a battle song using
 their own bodies as instruments.
 They are known as the Bapu, dancing warriors.
 Bapu
 Dancing Warriors
 They believe the more beautiful
 the sound produced, the stronger
 the spirit that descends.
 The most skilled Bapu are treated as gods,
 and hold more influence than the elders.
 Transform this melody into strength to fight!
 Battle Cantabile
 Battle Cantabile...
 Prologue
 Prologue!
 The blood of my tribe,
 the most beautiful in battle,
 flows through my veins.
 I swear on the names of the spirits and my tribe
 that you will not best me.
 Was that attack supposed
 to hold your tribe's pride?
 If so...
 You must not feel much pride.
 Don't bother recanting those words.
 They are but a beast's ramblings.
 They cannot affect me!
 In a one-on-one fight, my opponent's
 strength doesn't matter.
 If I can pierce it with this, I'll win.
 But I'm not certain I can pierce that...
 Those are sharp...
 I'll need to slip in between them
 and insert the antenna into the joint
 exposed when he moves the arm.
 Chance of succeeding unscathed...
 Twenty percent!
 Okay, it worked...
 Ow.
 Guess escaping unharmed wasn't possible.
 Huh?
 Why didn't it work?
 I put the antenna in...
 You must be a Manipulator.
 I can tell because, once you placed
 that antenna in Pell, you relaxed.
 That must be the condition
 for activating your power.
 You let your guard down
 when you thought it worked.
 Its name is Pell?
 You must also be a Manipulator.
 If my power doesn't activate after
 the condition has been met,
 that means my target is already being
 manipulated by another Nen user.
 That, and he has a remote controller.
 Oh, you knew?
 Yes, it's first come, first served for Manipulators.
 Once I take you to the Queen, my job is done.
 No good...
 I can't break free.
 Guess there's no choice.
 I'd rather not have to use this...
 Your punch stings about as
 much as a mosquito bite.
 What's next?
 You gonna kick me?
 Pull out a weapon?
 As a gift to you on your way to the afterlife,
 I'll grant you one more attack.
 For an ant, you know some big words.
 Then I'll take you up on that...
 And go with a punch.
 You're sure? Really?
 Fifteen should do it.
 Fifteen?
 Four, five, six...
 Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen...
 Fifteen!
 Huh?
 I get a free attack, right?
 W-Wait!
 Karmic Loop
 Every time I wind my arm, my punch gets stronger.
 Ripper Cyclotron!
 Ripper Cyclotron
 Oh, half of that would have been enough.
 I never seem to know how much power to use.
 Now, then...
 Which way to go?
 Right?
 Or left?
 I'll flip a coin.
 What's going to happen to me?
 You'll become a slave.
 You'll work for the Queen until you die.
 Not too different from your current life.
 That's true, in a sense.
 I'd just be taking orders from a different person.
 But I'd rather die than listen
 to someone I don't even like.
 Strong words.
 Well, at this point, all you
 can move is your mouth.
 I can move both hands and my left leg.
 That's nice.
 Anyway, ready for me to take control?
 I can't let you die.
 Once I put this in you...
 When I fight, I always carry two antennae.
 For just this kind of situation.
 First come, first served.
 He stuck it in himself!
 Autopilot on.
 S-So much aura...
 Enemy identified.
 Eliminating now.
 Go, Pell!
 Aim for his leg! Remove the antenna!
 Mission complete.
 Autopilot disengaging.
 Powering off.
 Ow...
 I already feel it...
 I'll be down with muscle aches
 for two or three days.
 That's why I hate using this!
 It makes me stronger, but there's a hefty price.
 And I remember nothing that happened,
 so I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.
 You have considerable power for a lady.
 Where was she hiding that vacuum cleaner?
 His thread is strong.
 If I get caught in it, I won't be able to escape.
 Where's the Queen?
 Rejoice.
 She stands before you now.
 That's a lame joke.
 Huh? A joke?
 You have no manners, brat.
 This warrants a hefty punishment.
 They are but a beast's ramblings.
 Then I'll take you up on that.
 When I fight, I always carry two antennae.
 It sounds like Feitan found the Queen...
 How do I kill her first?
 What's this? A child?
 Hey, little girl, come over here.
 I refuse.
 Rejected...
 Then I'll come to you.
 I'm in a hurry right now.
 What's that?
 Confetti.
 Wind!
 That didn't even tickle.
 Surrounding me with more paper?
 You're wasting your time!
 Look.
 What? You think that means something?
 You really are a stupid kid!
 Impossible...
 This rope is made of steel!
 My fan is made of paper.
 Meandering Dance

 Decent reaction.
 A hidden blade?
 You like hiding things on you, little boy?
 As do you.
 When an opponent wears baggy clothing,
 it's safe to assume they're hiding something.
 What's wrong?
 Are you not going to continue your attack?
 That is the only way to stop my performance.
 You'll pay for this!
 Pike...
 If I get Pike to use his thread
 to tangle up this guy,
 he can't make any sound!
 Next time, I'll rip you apart!
 Your escape is certainly fast...
 But not as fast as the speed of sound.

 Carnage x And x Devastation
 The Chimera Ant Zazan has
 built her nest in Meteor City.
 Calling herself the Queen,
 she seeks to conquer the world.
 The ones who have risen to quell her
 ambitions are inhabitants of this city...
 The Phantom Troupe.
 Where's everyone else?
 Beats me...
 Maybe still playing around?
 Rather than obliterating my opponent,
 I should have enjoyed myself...
 That took longer than expected...
 I should break my habit
 of beating my targets to a pulp.
 You're no match for me!
 Come back when you're stronger.
 Fair point.
 My, you took that well.
 Looks like I've lost my touch.
 But this is a perfect opportunity to practice.
 I'm stuck on defense...
 He's fast, and has twice as many limbs.
 I need to create an opening.
 Again?
 Now I'm certain...
 The moment I think I'm rid of it,
 she pulls that vacuum cleaner
 out of nowhere again.
 Her power lets her pull out
 and store objects at will?
 I see... Very interesting...
 And I can't catch her with my sticky webs.
 This girl is good,
 but I can't let her get away.
 This technique is a literal pain in the ass.
 But I have no choice!

 I'll hand you over to Zazan-sama.
 Will Zazan-sama praise me?
 It got lighter?
 Impossible—
 How?!
 How did she escape?
 Huh?
 I get it...
 You ditched your clothes.
 I understand.
 She widened an opening in my web to
 slip through, while protecting her skin.
 With her power, it's feasible.
 She left her vacuum cleaner in the web...
 But after escaping, she can make it
 disappear and call it to her again.
 However!
 Now that you've removed your clothes,
 you can't use the same trick again!
 The same applies to you.
 I've learned the range and speed of your webs.
 And I won't mention that his anus
 twitches twice before he fires.
 You won't catch me again.
 I'll keep my distance.
 Blinky and I have won.
 Won?
 Such a stupid girl...
 You can't do anything while running away.
 I said that I'll keep my distance,
 but I didn't say anything about running.
 I'll show you the difference.
 Blinky...
 Suck every last drop of blood from his body.
 What... Wh-Wh-What?
 Stop it!
 H-Hey...
 Y-You little...
 Weakling!
 Uh-oh, this is bad...
 I'm getting dizzy.
 I have to stop the blood loss!
 (How's that?)
 (Now you can't suck my blood...)
 There's more?
 From here?
 And here?
 I... I can't block everywhere!
 You're bleeding from twenty-nine different wounds.
 Based on currently available information,
 it's impossible for you to cover
 each wound with your eight limbs...
 Not without another ace in the hole.
 All cleaned up.
 Huh?
 Hmm...
 Ah, you know those webs
 you were shooting out?
 By covering your body with them,
 couldn't you have stopped the bleeding?
 We're both pretty stupid...
 What is this?
 How can they move so fast?
 Looks like he's moving a little better now.
 He has a ways to go before
 he's back to full strength.
 They were already here, enjoying the show.
 I wasted some time fooling around,
 but I was by no means slow...
 Five?
 No, seven?
 How many feints was that?
 And how can he leap from
 that position while attacki—
 Ah! He's already over there!
 I can't believe it...
 He's on a completely
 different level.
 Whoa, everyone's already here?
 Going for a new look?
 I got caught in my opponent's webs.
 Wait, you actually lost—
 I won.
 She's really mad!
 Feitan's the only one left.
 His opponent's pretty strong.
 It's probably the Queen.
 But Feitan looks sluggish.
 He isn't back to full strength yet...
 We know! You already said that!
 I'm still too weak.
 Behind me?
 What's with this guy?
 He keeps getting faster?
 And more of his buddies keep showing up.
 Curse those worthless idiots!
 All of them were defeated?!
 I didn't think your skin would be so tough.
 Cur...
 Curse you!
 How dare you damage my face?!
 I'll kill you!
 Ko!
 She left herself wide open.
 I'm not nice enough to overlook that.
 Her attack didn't hit him...
 No, she sent a little aura with that swing.
 Feitan's idea to use Ko backfired.
 After focusing his aura into one point,
 he didn't expect to deal no damage.
 The miscalculation left him a second
 late guarding with his Nen.
 In other words, he was basically defenseless.
 A puny Emitter attack could
 have dealt serious damage.
 She knows how to use her aura.
 She has good reason to call herself Queen.
 This body has no weaknesses!
 Shouldn't we help him?
 Huh? Why?
 This is a race...
 If he loses, the next person gets to try.
 Who's up next?
 We use order of arrival.
 That's me, then.
 Wait...
 We both arrived at the same time.
 Fool, I was waiting until you finished your fight.
 Now, now... We'll flip a coin to decide.
 S-Something's...
 wrong with them!
 Heads.
 Then if Feitan's defeated, I go next.
 Bah.
 I was naïve...
 I thought I could become
 number two in no time.
 But I'm utterly outclassed...
 It's hopeless.
 But I won't give up.
 I'm used to toughing it out.
 All for the sake of retrieving my brother,
 no matter how long it takes.
 There goes his left arm.
 Fei, wanna trade places?
 ""Piece of crap...""
 ""Know your place.""
 Crap, run for it...
 You're gonna get caught in it.
 When he snaps, he'll hit
 everything around him!
 We tried to watch him once
 before and almost died.
 His power has a huge range,
 and activates with his anger,
 so it knows no restraint.
 If you get caught up in the
 one he's using this time,
 you're dead, Kalluto.
 This time?
 The attack has other forms?
 Darn, I want to see!
 What?
 When did he put that on?!
 Wait... More importantly,
 he's much stronger now!
 ""Now I return your pain.""
 Feel the heat...
 Pain Packer
 Unforgiven
 Pain Packer!
 Rising Sun.
 Burnt by the Sun
 ""Is it hot?""
 ""Throat too scorched to even breathe?""
 ""You could try to run.""
 ""Assuming you can even move...""
 ""What's wrong?""
 ""Make use of that tough body you're so proud of.""
 Impossible...
 I am the Queen...
 I cannot die here...
 Out of fuel already?
 And the heat wasn't that strong...
 How unfortunate...
 You could have had a quicker death
 if you'd dealt me more damage.
 Well, you only have yourself to blame.
 They didn't revert after the Queen's death...
 But they're no longer under the Queen's control.
 Ple... ...me...
 Please... ki...
 Please... kill... me...
 Please...
 Kill us...
 Hell, no.
 I don't do mercy killings.
 Attack me, trash!
 You were living in this place, right?!
 Have the guts to defend it to the end!
 You can die with a bang!
 Now those geezers
 are arguing over whether to exact
 revenge upon the real queen.
 Man, I'm sick of those idiots.
 All they do is sit around a table,
 squawking about doing the impossible.
 But you're still sticking around, right?
 There's nothing else for me to do.
 If more Ants show up,
 I'll wipe them out at once.
 So I don't have to do any more cleanup.
 Is it the boss?!
 No, it's Nobunaga.
 He's asking if we'll help with his job.
 What was that?
 No way, fool!
 Man, this sucks.
 I hate having to wait.
 Phinks, you sound like some girl with a crush.
 He's being very feminine.
 Eh?
 What was that, bastards?!
 Say that again...
 I'll kill you!
 Hey! We're hurt!
 The Phantom Troupe has saved Meteor
 City from the Chimera Ant invasion.
 Meanwhile...
 Gon and Killua are preparing to
 infiltrate the Republic of East Gorteau.
 The selection of citizens to present
 to the King by his own guards...
 ...will begin in nine days.
 Next time: Infiltration x And x Selection.
 Meleoron the Chameleon.
 Meleoron the Chameleon.
 Meleoron the Chaleleron!
 Meleoron the Chameleon...

98,"To become kings, the Chimera Ants
 have spread across the world,
 committing acts of utmost
 tyranny wherever they go.
 Fearing the damage will spread,
 the government asks the Hunter
 Association to exterminate them.
 Finally, the Hunter Association makes its move.
 Ah, is that all?
 Infiltration x And x Selection
 Sneaking in was easy.
 But the question is how to get
 close enough to the enemy.
 And we can't let just anyone see us, either.
 Informants
 This country has a powerful
 information regulation system that
 operates in secret using groups of informants.
 Informants?
 Yeah, if you discover an enemy spy,
 you receive a reward.
 If you find evidence of insurgency,
 you receive a reward.
 If you stop someone from fleeing the
 country, you receive a reward.
 So the people will do anything for that reward.
 And they aren't just after money.
 After racking up enough informant points,
 the entire group is promoted.
 But if someone provides false information
 or a member commits a crime,
 the entire group is punished.
 Carrot and stick, huh?
 It's pretty nasty business.
 Family members are put in different groups.
 So if an entire group tries to escape,
 the other family members can be
 executed or imprisoned for life.
 If a family is caught trying to escape together,
 they'll be executed, no questions asked.
 For this country's elite to live the good life,
 the rest of its citizens must scrape by.
 But the media also spreads lies.
 Such as that, in other countries,
 half the population starves by age ten.
 Foreign aid never reaches the needy.
 Instead, it's spent on cars, jewels, and missiles.
 It's even said that East Gorteau spends
 grant money developing nuclear weapons
 that become bargaining chips in negotiations
 for unprecedented foreign aid increases.
 Hey, don't overheat!
 I th-think I'm okay...
 That was just so complicated...
 But you sure know a lot about it.
 My brother told me everything.
 And he probably heard it from Grandpa.
 Your grandpa?
 Yeah. Long ago, he infiltrated
 the country for a job.
 And I've seen similar information
 on Hunter websites.
 The system is likely still in use.
 There's a village.
 Yeah... It's not very big.
 What do we do?
 Sneak in.
 Is that a good idea?
 We need current information.
 Knowing what kinds of clothes they wear or
 how to identify someone's rank will help.
 They may have certain practices to root out spies.
 The more data we have, the better.
 Wait here.
 It's completely deserted...
 Maybe everyone already left for Peijing?
 No, something happened here.
 And someone's trying to hide it.
 Huh?
 They did a sloppy job.
 They didn't dig deep enough,
 so wild dogs got to the bodies.
 I'd imagine the entire village is buried here.
 What's going on?
 This is the true purpose of
 the national celebration.
 It's a pretense for entire populations of towns
 and cities to vanish without raising suspicion.
 The selection has already begun.
 In hindsight,
 it would be tough to summon all citizens to
 the capital and make the selection so quickly.
 This nation has a population
 of around five million.
 Clearing out one town or city
 at a time is more effective.
 In that case, their only concern would
 be coworkers or family members
 raising a fuss over the missing.
 But with the pretext of the national celebration,
 no one will find it strange that
 they can't contact someone.
 In this nation, cell phones aren't allowed,
 so if they believe the other party is traveling,
 it makes sense that they can't contact them.
 The selection will go very smoothly.
 The capital city, Peijing, is in the southeast corner.
 They only need to attack the farthest
 towns first and work their way east.
 If each town is told that the government
 will assign its people a time to depart,
 there won't be any problems regarding
 communication between towns.
 So, by preventing people from meeting
 between towns to travel together,
 they eliminate any cause for commotion.
 But...
 Hmm?
 That means
 they have to run around the nation
 to attack all five million citizens.
 Yeah.
 If one percent survives, that gives
 them fifty thousand soldiers.
 No, I mean before that.
 There are ten... No, nine days left.
 If you wanted to check five
 million people in that time,
 you'd need a lot of help.
 Assuming that one Nen user
 can check ten thousand citizens in ten days...
 Five hundred Nen users.
 Exactly!
 You're getting at the fact that there can't
 be that many Ants who can use Nen?
 Yeah.
 I agree, but it probably isn't that hard.
 They don't need Nen users to check everyone.
 Huh? Why not?
 They can use manipulation.
 The power that Chimera Ant used...
 I'm guessing it can be used
 to automate victims or,
 like Genthru's power, can probably be
 used to control multiple people at once.
 Ordinary humans have aura as well,
 so the manipulator could force a
 victim's aura to concentrate in his fist.
 One punch alone could create
 an army of fifty thousand.
 While leaving four million, nine hundred
 and fifty thousand dead in the process.
 Well, it isn't all bad news.
 If my theory is correct,
 causing a commotion to stop their
 selection will be simple.
 We merely have to pop up,
 take out whoever is being controlled,
 and cause a panic.
 Then we just encourage
 the people who escape to
 check on other towns nearby.
 If the Chimera Ants have sent controlled
 puppets, rather than actual Nen users,
 taking them down will be a cinch.
 We'll just run around, taking them down
 one after another, and wreak havoc.
 Yeah.
 The problem is that they'll detect us quickly.
 Once we make our move,
 they'll know we're here.
 If we want to go with the old man's
 plan, we should stay hidden.
 What do you think?
 Let's do it.
 If the selection has already begun,
 we can't just stand around watching.
 Okay, let's do it.
 Uh-huh!
 But I'll do this alone.
 Huh?
 You stay in hiding.
 Why?
 It'll go better if we bothâ€”
 Don't forget our main mission!
 Defeating that Chimera Ant.
 That should be your focus.
 Let me handle everything else.
 I'll stir things up.
 And no offense, but I work more easily alone.
 Jeez... Fine, I got it.
 Really?
 Huh?
 Do you really understand?
 Killua?
 Promise me you won't make a move!
 Not even if people are killed
 right before your eyes!
 Promise!
 I'll contact you by text.
 Our cell phones should still work in this area.
 Killua?
 Sorry... It's nothing!
 I'm just a little tense.
 What's this?
 They aren't citizens of this country.
 I would expect a couple of kids to be spies.
 But they're definitely strong...
 Are they assassins?
 Are they here to hunt down the King?
 Then I can't ignore them...
 But I don't want to fight them both at once.
 I definitely don't want to fight the
 silver-haired one on the left.
 Just watching him walk, I can tell he's strong.
 As much potential as a Squadron Leader?
 That kid is something special.
 I completely concealed my presence,
 but he still sensed something?
 How convenient!
 Are you sure about this?
 You'll really transport my family
 and me to another country?
 Do not worry.
 We have received official approval,
 and prepared the necessary documents.
 All that's left is for you to sign the papers.
 However, the condition that you share
 your complete knowledge of military affairs
 in exchange for your freedom is essential.
 As mentioned in the agreement,
 if you do not keep up your end after signing,
 we shall both find ourselves in difficult positions.
 That won't be a problem.
 I'll tell you everything...
 All I know about the atrocities
 that Diego has committed.
 We appreciate it.
 Our lives are on the line, as well.
 ""That Diego has committed""?
 You talk like it doesn't concern you.
 The wine you're drinking and
 the room you stand in
 were earned by following that bastard.
 You mean ""that we've committed,""
 you son of a bitch.
 But I get it... We're here on business.
 So, Marcos-san...
 Continue going about your business as normal.
 In two weeks, you and your family
 will be relaxing on the beach.
 I can't accept it!
 We're supposed to stand around,
 watching as people are killed?
 Are you sleepy?
 Want me to put you to sleep, eh?
 Calm yourself.
 If they're gonna check five
 million citizens in ten days,
 simple arithmetic says that's
 five hundred thousand per day!
 Of which one percent will survive!
 And your point is?
 That means four hundred, ninety-five
 thousand have already been killed!
 How can you be so calm?
 Because if we lose our cool, billions could die!
 If the plan fails, everyone dies.
 If we can't draw the three Royal
 Guards away from the King,
 not even the Chairman will
 be able to defeat the King.
 Thus, we cannot let them discover
 our existence before the time is right.
 If that happens, security around the
 King will be even further tightened.
 You must endure this.
 You're telling me to sacrifice five
 million to save the human race?
 That's right.
 If blaming me consoles you, go ahead.
 But if you don't have a better idea,
 don't be too self-righteous.
 Damn it...
 We must do only what we can.
 But we must put our lives on the line to do so.
 Yeah...
 Is Killua okay?
 He was acting a little weird.
 Maybe I should have stuck with him?
 But if I'd followed him, he'd be mad.
 You did well to avoid that.
 How about this?
 I use my strong tail as a spring,
 to propel me among the trees!
 In the darkness, following my
 movement is impossible!
 Caught you!
 Now I'm going to crush you!
 You're not crushing me!
 Huh?
 I'm the one who caught you!
 He seems to have a snake's genes,
 so he should be able to go ten
 days without starving to death.
 As I thought... He's strong...
 But I should continue to observe.
 I already let them find me...
 I need to hide better.
 But it's strange...
 Why are there soldiers around if the
 selection is already finished here?
 Maybe there are extra guards
 because we're near the border.
 An owl and a bat?
 This time, he's facing two...
 What will he do?
 The Chimera Ants are using
 darkness to attack Gon.
 And why is Meleoron following him?
 Next time: Combination x And x Evolution.

 which has not been touched.

99,"After Gon parts ways with Killua
 in order to stop the selection,
 he finds himself under attack
 by new Chimera Ants.
 An owl and a bat?
 They're both nocturnal creatures...
 Hunters of the night!
 From the left?
 Bring it!
 The owl's feathers?
 Damn...
 The bat's wings are so loud,
 I can't hear the owl at all!
 Combination x And x Evolution
 My ears can pick up sounds of
 higher frequency than other animals'.
 I can hear you stepping on leaves
 and your clothes rustling.
 All of which tell me exactly where you are!
 From the right this time!
 The owl uses its feathers to distract me
 right before the bat attacks...
 They're using both long- and short-range attacks.
 Wait...
 That means...
 He has a lot of aura... But it won't help.
 We are unrivaled in the darkness!
 I should approach this the opposite way!
 If the owl is acting in a support role,
 I should focus on the sound of the bat's wings.
 Right after the owl attacks,
 the bat will attack!
 Now!
 Bingo!
 I missed?
 But my timing was perfect!
 Ultrasonic waves?
 Damn, I missed again?
 Bah, he's correctly guessing
 the direction of my attacks.
 For a human, his ears are sharp.
 And his aura keeps growing,
 so my feathers aren't doing any damage.
 The bat uses ultrasonic waves to
 anticipate the timing of my attack.
 Unless I find a way to stop it, I can't win!
 First comes rock...
 His aura continues to grow.
 This could pose a problem.
 Not at all...
 This is our chance.
 He's probably using his ultimate attack.
 If we can evade it, we've won.
 I can use my ultrasonic waves
 to see it in advance.
 Do you need help?
 Wait, I'll try getting closer as quietly as I can.
 The sound's moving away.
 The sound's gone!
 Now, with no wingbeats...
 I dive!
 That won't work!
 Your wings aren't like the owl's,
 so I can hear you slice through the air.
 Now, show me your ultimate attack.
 He isn't acting?
 I guess a human can only hear so much.
 In that case, I'll make my move...
 I'll slash your jugular!
 Keep my motions minimal.
 Wait until I draw her as near as possible!
 He was baiting me?
 I'm in trouble.
 But his punch will take a
 few milliseconds to land.
 I have plenty of time to fly away!
 The noise...
 I can't see.
 I must get away!
 You won't escape!
 Rock...
 You aren't the only one that can use sound...
 Paper...
 ...to locate others.
 Paper!
 All right.
 A rock?
 He used that to deflect my shot?
 Gorilla Mode
 That was close...
 Damn it!
 I used my special attack and
 still couldn't bring it down!
 What was that?
 There was a sound that made my head spin.
 Is this ultrasound, too?
 That stupid kid has a loud voice...
 But I'm much better at attacking with sound!
 This is the true power of their combination.
 They strike with sound and finish with brawn.
 What now?
 Do I cover my ears?
 No, I can't...
 In the darkness, if I handicap my hearing,
 my reaction time will suffer.
 I know!
 Gyo!
 His eyes are shining?
 Or is that aura?
 He'll rely on his eyes, ignoring sound?
 Let's give him another...
 Ultrasonic Dissonance
 Secret Noise!
 Okay!
 This should help some.
 He spit on cloth to make earplugs. Clever...
 Water significantly weakens the power of sound!
 Good, this is better...
 I can locate the owl through its aura.
 Here it comes!
 A feather?
 Zetsu.
 Of course... They started off as wild animals.
 From birth, they've known
 to conceal themselves
 when approaching their prey!
 I can fend off their attacks,
 but the ultrasound really hurts.
 If I don't keep up the Gyo,
 they'll take me down before
 I can even find them!
 In terms of latent aura,
 the kid has a clear advantage.
 Even after being hit all those times,
 he's taken no damage.
 But his level of capability is irrelevant.
 Without a strategy, he's just a moving target.
 They work in perfect sync.
 I have to disrupt that!
 Ah, he thinks that if he's right on top
 of me, we can't use ultrasound.
 Wrong guess!
 If I use Rock, I can defeat this one.
 But then the bat might run
 and warn the other Ants!
 To me, a starry night is as bright as day.
 As long as I'm not in total darkness,
 I can see you without needing
 to rely on my hearing!
 So if I cover my ears...
 I can attack at will!
 The kid has shrouded his entire
 body in aura to avoid damage.
 But that reduces the strength of his attacks,
 making it impossible to stand against them.
 At this rate, he'll never defeat them...
 It's over for this kid.
 Their weakness is that
 their movements are always in sync!
 Here!
 They always take positions on opposite sides
 to avoid both being targeted at once.
 When the owl is in front of me,
 the bat is directly behind me!
 A giant wall?
 The real wall was
 behind me...
 He turned our teamwork against us?
 If I only have one opponent,
 I can concentrate on attacking.
 Once he pulls off one plan,
 things will go his way...
 But that attack won't be enough
 to get him anywhere here.
 Damn!
 First comes rock...
 Rock... Paper...
 Why, you...
 Rock!
 I made sure to knock you west!
 Go back to NGL!
 That was incredibly strong...
 I see... This is his real ultimate attack.
 I take back what I said.
 This kid can be useful.
 But how do I proceed?
 Diego has been dethroned.
 Brainwashed soldiers are running around,
 slaughtering entire villages and towns!
 Diego has fallen?
 Is that true?
 But we all saw the soldiers try to kill everyone.
 There's no time to think about it!
 Just leave this village and run, anywhere!
 Warn people in other areas!
 Who's interfering?
 It was in the southeast this time.
 Some of my puppets have been stopped.
 That was fast.
 Whoever they are, they're keeping
 low and unpredictable.
 An assassin?
 But they are acting on their own...
 A decoy?
 This is so annoying...
 I wanna kill them!
 It is no more than a diversion.
 Which means we cannot go.
 You think?
 But it doesn't feel like the purpose is to bait us.
 They're being careful not to let me catch them...
 It may all be an act to draw you out.
 But perhaps I'm over-thinking things.
 But... But...
 Ah, how I long to indulge myself
 in the delight of agonizing...
 It is the sweet trap of the thought process.
 Nothing more.
 The answer is simple.
 Our mission is to protect the King.
 We can let the other Ants handle the rest.
 Is it our turn?
 When we were injured
 and on the run from the Hunters, you took us in.
 You even gave us instruction on using our power.
 It is time for us to return the favor!
 Someone's running around
 and disabling my puppets.
 Can you kill them?
 You can count on me.
 Take this cell phone.
 We can't use telepathy.
 I'll give you updates on their location.
 Understood.
 Can we really trust them?
 Nah, I don't trust them.
 They're the ones trying to earn our trust,
 so they'll try hard to carry out their mission.
 It's possible that they're looking for an
 opportunity to stab us in the back.
 In that case, we should treat them accordingly.
 The closest village is at two o'clock.
 The next closest villages are
 at eight and ten o'clock...
 Should I skip them and head for
 Taba, forty kilometers away?
 Play it safe...
 Don't let anyone find me.
 I can't go this way.
 This is bad...
 I should have taken matters into my own hands.
 What's wrong?
 As we speak, Cheetu is racing
 toward East Gorteau.
 It seems the Hunters that replaced
 us failed to capture him.
 Is he headed toward us?
 No, if he continues on his current
 course, he'll pass far to the south.
 Where are you going?
 Don't try to stop me...
 I'm already in a bad mood.
 The Hunter Association has captured three
 hundred and nineteen Chimera Ants
 outside of NGL as of yesterday.
 But Colt confirmed that none of
 them were Squadron Leaders.
 According to him,
 there are eight Squadron Leaders left
 that would be considered aggressive.
 Hunters have encountered four,
 but they all got away.
 Cheetu is coming to East Gorteau for a reason.
 He must know the King is here.
 He's choosing to return to the King's
 service in order to increase his power.
 My ability is still in effect,
 and I have more raw strength.
 But if we let him slip away and
 he gains even more power,
 there's no telling who will win next time.
 If we allow more Ants like him to join the King,
 we'll never be able to draw the Royal Guard away.
 Are you still gonna try to stop me? Eh?
 If you are, I'll fight you first.
 First, we contact Morel-san.
 If worse comes to worst,
 he'll need to replace us.
 I'll come with you.
 This should increase the odds
 of capturing that Ant.
 It's Knuckle... Something's come up.
 Yes, I'd guess so.
 Probably.
 Yes.
 So, uh...
 Hello? Hello?
 Fools!
 I told you to send Riakke!
 He'd have been perfect for this.
 Huh?!
 I don't give a damn!
 What's wrong?
 The Chimera Ant we were tracking escaped.
 The review board didn't send
 the Hunter we requested!
 Who did they send?
 Some Hunter I've never heard of.
 Probably an Association dog.
 An Association dog...
 You mean Hunters who only take jobs
 through the Hunter Association.
 It isn't surprising that they have less talent.
 Damn! I should have gone
 to talk to Riakke myself!
 Don't be foolish!
 If you do anything without board approval,
 the Chairman will get all the grief.
 He had to argue with the executive
 committee just to get the two of us here.
 But they don't understand the situation.
 They base it on past accomplishments
 and donations to the Association...
 The review board has always been inflexible.
 How can you be so relaxed?!
 If we underestimate the Squadron
 Leaders, we'll pay dearly for it.
 They're strong.
 After all, they listen to their deepest desires.
 So they have the talent to quickly master
 the abilities they need the most.
 If we let the review board bring self-preservation
 and formality in, we won't get help in time.
 Maybe that's their goal...
 You refer to the rumors that
 the Vice-Chairman's faction
 controls the review board?
 That they're only giving work to Hunters
 who agree to vote for him in the next election?
 There's no evidence of anything
 like that happening.
 You think they're stupid enough to get caught?
 Look at the facts!
 They've let every Squadron Leader
 they've faced escape alive!
 If this expedition fails,
 the Chairman will shoulder the blame.
 They're willing to do whatever it
 takes to guarantee that result.
 As the Chimera Ants claim more victims,
 the voices calling for the Chairman's
 resignation grow louder.
 Too bad the voices belong to a bunch
 of people sitting at their desks!
 If we take out the King and five million
 people are already dead, we've failed!
 We already knew that.
 The Chairman is prepared.
 When he developed this plan, he was
 well aware of the consequences.
 He knew how long assuring victory would take,
 and the resulting casualties...
 Five million is the low end...
 That's too high!
 Marcos-san?
 What?
 The phones have been ringing nonstop!
 Rumors of a coup d'Ă©tat are flying around.
 And it's been discovered that mass murders
 are taking place all over the nation.
 This is no rumor. It's actually happening!
 What's going on here?
 Are you responsible for this?
 We haven't done anything!
 The citizens have learned the
 truth about the selection?
 We'll discuss this later.
 Return to the office before anyone suspects you.
 Morel!
 Our beloved leader, Diego, has an
 urgent announcement to make.
 To ensure that our great leader's message
 will be heard throughout the nation,
 we request that relay speakers in all
 regions be turned to maximum volume.
 All televisions and radios should be on,
 and the volume raised to maximum.
 Good evening, my beloved comrades.
 I am Diego.
 I have just declared that East
 Gorteau is under martial law.
 This precaution is being taken to combat
 malcontents that would foment rebellion.
 I ask all comrades to stay indoors,
 with your doors locked.
 Anyone outdoors without permission will
 be identified as a rebel and punished.
 I ask that you not lend an ear
 to false rumors being spread,
 but that you follow my instructions.
 The soldiers of my special forces
 will be visiting your residences,
 to see if any rebels are hiding inside.
 Do not open your doors for anyone else.
 Their response was too fast.
 It must be Killua and Gon.
 They weren't supposed to act.
 But this must be part of the Chimera Ants' plan.
 They were so well-prepared,
 I can't believe otherwise.
 The citizens learning the truth about
 the selection wasn't important.
 In fact, if they did, the military
 would have an excuse to mobilize.
 East Gorteau has been placed under martial law,
 completely isolated from the rest of the world.
 Hmm... No problem.
 You can bring out tanks and fighter jets.
 I will stop them all.
 Next time: Tracking x And x Pursuit.

 We hope you keep watching!
