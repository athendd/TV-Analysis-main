59,"There he is.
 That's your target.
 The tycoon, Mr. Battera.
 Objective?
 That would be Greed Island, of course.
 Why are you so interested in a game?
 You've spent a considerable
 amount on it by now.
 It is an expression of love.
 Isn't wanting to monopolize
 that which you love natural?
 What is this love you mention?
 There are many rumors flying around.
 Any comments?
 I will get my hands on the clue Ging left!
 Bid x And x Haste
 What time is it?
 Kurapika!
 It's 2:00 PM.
 I slept for half a day?
 It's been two whole days, Kurapika...
 Where's the boss?
 What about the underground auction?
 It ended up being canceled.
 The rest of the merchandise
 will be auctioned online.
 The boss accepted that.
 You're lying.
 Eh?
 She was looking forward to
 taking part in the auction.
 I don't see her accepting that so easily...
 Squala was killed.
 And Eliza was inconsolable...
 The Scarlet Eyes we won were stolen.
 But apparently,
 the boss was severely shocked by Eliza's state.
 That was when she said
 she wanted to go home.
 I see.
 What about Gon and Killua?
 They're both fine.
 Around now...
 He fell asleep.
 They're doing what they need to do,
 so you should get plenty of rest.
 Our next item
 is the legendary game,
 Greed Island !
 Let's take a look at the mysterious
 power this game contains.
 As you can see, there is a mysterious power
 that protects the console from any damage,
 as long as someone is playing inside.
 This man is Jeitsari.
 He is a player who's inside
 the game at this moment.
 In fact, he's the one who signed a contract
 allowing us to auction it off.
 So this copy wasn't brought here by Ging.
 Jeitsari left behind the following agreement:
 ""If we cannot clear this game
 before the date specified in the contract,
 seven active players, including myself,
 will present seven copies
 of the game and console
 to the Southern Piece Auction,
 so our talented young Hunters
 can clear the game and fulfill our dream.""
 Unfortunately, when we
 obtained these copies,
 two already displayed game over screens.
 That means the players also died in real life.
 This dangerous game requires
 that you risk your own life!
 Make sure you're prepared before you bid.
 Let's start the bidding at 900 million Jenny!
 I have 1 billion!
 I have 1.5 billion!
 #105 doubles it to 3 billion.
 #71 doubles it again...
 to 6 billion!
 Hey! That's my brother!
 So you indicate how much
 you're bidding with your hand?
 Yeah,
 the auctioneer is able to
 instantly discern the highest bid.
 #16 doubles it again...
 to 12 billion!
 What's this?
 #201 doubles it again,
 to 24 billion!
 You idiot!
 #16 bids 25 billion!
 Whew, that was close...
 I'm guessing he wasn't able to
 decipher that memory card.
 #71 bids 25.5 billion...
 How much money does he have?
 #16 goes all the way up to 30.5 billion!
 Damn it!
 30.5 billion, huh?
 No matter...
 If we can clear this game.
 Um, we're Hunters.
 We're willing to help clear Greed Island.
 Don't joke around. Go on home.
 We're not joking! I'm a pro Hunter.
 What nonsense.
 Do you have a license?
 Yes!
 Uh, you don't.
 It's at the pawn shop.
 Oh.
 Uh, it's not on me...
 See... He's lying.
 I'm not lying!
 Hold on...
 The fact that you're here means
 you're certainly not ordinary.
 However, I can't blindly
 accept everything you say.
 I am indeed looking to hire
 Hunters in order to clear this game,
 but I cannot hire you at this time.
 Because there can only be so many players.
 Crap...
 Has our plan failed?
 I'm thinking that we don't
 need to buy the game.
 We just want the data inside it.
 And I bet some of the people
 who win copies of Greed Island
 will be looking for players, too.
 There can only be so many players?
 Each memory card only has the
 capacity to store one player's data.
 With multitaps, you can have a
 maximum of eight players per console.
 Oh, right.
 That Greed Island save used up
 all thirty blocks on that memory card.
 Yeah.
 How did you know that?!
 We have a Greed Island save file.
 Have you played the game before?
 No, we only have a memory card.
 Does that mean...
 If that memory card is real,
 you would need another item to remove the card
 from the console.
 Would that be...
 The ring?
 They know about the ring, too.
 It appears that they are worthy of consideration.
 I assume that you can use Nen.
 Show me your Ren.
 Sure!
 Well?
 It's hopeless.
 Letting them play would be a waste of time.
 They'd run around in circles until they died.
 How can you be certain when we haven't tried?!
 It'll be too late once you're in the game, kid.
 Unless you die off immediately.
 We don't need people who'll
 drag out the inevitable.
 As long as a player is alive inside the game,
 you can't reset or remove the memory card.
 In other words, you can't send in new players.
 I've hired around one hundred
 pro and amateur Hunters to play this game,
 and over half of them have given up.
 Given up?
 They've given up on returning to the real world,
 choosing to live inside the game.
 That is why I must be careful
 when selecting players.
 We need people
 who are strong enough to obtain items
 for returning to the real world.
 And you're saying we aren't strong enough?
 How can he know that?
 Because he's a pro Hunter who
 has played Greed Island before.
 Speaking from my own experience,
 the items for returning to the real
 world are relatively easy to obtain.
 But with your Nen, it's hopeless.
 In fact, it'd be game over in no time.
 Once the screening is done,
 I'm returning to the game.
 Screening?
 You're screening players?
 Yes, the screening will be
 on the auction's final day.
 If you're interested in participating,
 you'll need to work on your Nen.
 We were going to do that anyway!
 Let's go, Killua!
 Before you go, kid...
 How did you come by a memory card?
 I'm not telling you!
 Damn it... I'm mad now.
 We absolutely must pass their screening!
 Screening...
 What's the plan?
 You even need to ask?
 We're bandits.
 We steal.
 Let's return to the base and play.
 A memory card is already inserted,
 so only one more can play.
 We can use a multitap.
 Four more can play now.
 Nice...
 So who goes first?
 I'll go first.
 Whoa...
 He really did disappear.
 I was kind of skeptical...
 What was that?
 It's a game. Wanna play?
 I'll pass.
 If I feel like it.
 Okay.
 Catch you later, then.
 He disappeared, too.
 What kind of game is this?
 A game where you can actually die.
 It's listed in the auction catalog.
 I'm so mad!
 I can't believe how he spouted off!
 Damn it!
 Still, he's right.
 What do you mean?
 Chill out a little.
 We should start thinking about
 taking this to the next level.
 Next level?
 Hatsu.
 You know, our special abilities.
 Kurapika started learning Nen when we did.
 But he was able to fight the Troupe
 because of his special abilities.
 Yeah, Kurapika obtained powers that
 make him basically invincible against the Troupe
 by placing his life on the line.
 We can't follow his example.
 We need abilities without
 too much or too little risk,
 which still fit our specialties.
 Something practical and effective...
 That's what we have to come up with.
 Well, I knew this would happen.
 Let's take this one step at a time.
 First, what kind of abilities do you want?
 What kind of abilities do I want?
 Hey!
 You must have at least a vague idea.
 Uh, a really strong power!
 That's too vague!
 Start by thinking within your own category.
 You're an Enhancer,
 so think of a power that strengthens something.
 Then we ask,
 what part of you do you
 want to strengthen, and how?
 That hurt!
 What about you, then?
 I already know what I want.
 That's why I'm helping you.
 Really? What do you want?
 It's a secret.
 Huh?
 Gon, I'm going to go start
 practicing my special ability.
 You keep thinking about it.
 Though it's possible that I'm the only
 one who'll pass the screening.
 He'll just get distracted
 unless I give him a scare.
 Visualize my aura fusing with electricity.
 Then I visualize
 the electricity being released,
 while refining my Nen!
 But with your Nen,
 it'd be game over in no time.
 Damn it!
 I'll make him eat those words!
 You sound determined, Gon.
 Kurapika!
 Are you better?
 Yeah, my fever broke.
 I'm fine now.
 He doesn't look fine.
 But if Kurapika finds out
 that the spiders are still in Yorknew City...
 Is there any way to stop him?
 So how did the auction go?
 I believe you were after an expensive game?
 Oh, yeah...
 Tea
 I see.
 So they're screening players...
 Say, what kind of training did you do?
 Once I decided to conjure chains,
 I did a lot of image training...
 I closed my eyes, while feeling real chains.
 I drew hundreds, thousands of sketches.
 I looked at chains, licked chains...
 I also smelled and listened to chains.
 My master told me to do nothing
 but handle chains all the time.
 After a while, he took them away.
 That was when I began to hallucinate chains...
 Eventually, those hallucinations
 began to feel heavy and cold,
 and I could hear them grating.
 Once I reached that point,
 I was able to conjure chains.
 Other than that, I did the same training as you.
 Ten and Ren.
 I know, Kurapika...
 You can be my master!
 You can point out what I'm doing right.
 This way, I can keep Kurapika occupied
 while the auction takes place.
 I'm sorry, but I cannot.
 Huh?
 My boss will be leaving tomorrow.
 I am obligated to accompany her.
 You're leaving Yorknew City?
 Yeah.
 I'm still concerned about the spiders...
 But it's been two days,
 so they're probably already gone.
 Yeah, that's a good idea.
 Who taught you Nen?
 You should probably
 ask them rather than me.
 Special abilities?
 That sounds like you boys.
 I can tell you right now
 that Enhancers don't need special abilities.
 Why not?
 Because Enhancers are the
 most balanced between offense and defense.
 If you master Ten and Ren,
 those will be strong enough to be
 considered special abilities.
 But I don't have time.
 I have to pass a screening in four days...
 Gon-kun,
 if I were a judge,
 I would be disappointed to see
 an improvised special ability.
 Listen carefully, Gon-kun.
 You must not emulate that Kurapika person.
 I'm sure you don't need me to tell you why.
 No...
 You needn't emulate anyone else
 when you're already so strong.
 You think so?
 Of course.
 Reflect on the things you've been able to do.
 That should help you find the answer you seek.
 A-A hint...
 Please give me a hint!
 You sound pretty flustered...
 Haste makes waste.
 In the end, hard work always pays off.
 I would agree if it weren't for this deadline...
 All right, here's a big hint, then.
 You only showed that Tsezgerra
 person your normal Ren, right?
 Yeah.
 Next time, show him everything simultaneously.
 Everything?
 Yes, listen carefully.
 Show him everything you've
 learned simultaneously.
 Everything I've learned simultaneously.
 Ten...
 Shroud myself in aura.
 Zetsu...
 Suppress my aura.
 Ren...
 Bring forth an incredible amount of aura.
 And Hatsu...
 Wait.
 Ren requires me to bring forth aura,
 while Zetsu requires suppressing it.
 If I do them both at once...
 Oh?
 His brain fried again?
 Hang in there, Gon.
 If you take too long,
 I'll leave you behind!
 It's impossible...
 How do I bring forth and suppress
 something at the same time?
 Reflect on the things you've been able to do.
 After Wing-san helped unleash my Nen,
 I went into battle knowing only Ten,
 and got myself seriously hurt.
 But in the process, I mastered Zetsu.
 Then I learned Gyo to see through
 Hisoka's special ability.
 Gyo?
 Right! I have Gyo!
 Gyo...
 Concentrate aura in your eyes
 to see hidden aura.
 Concentrate?
 Right, I concentrated on my eyes,
 so I never noticed what else was happening.
 There's a little aura being released.
 If I can suppress it,
 I'll be doing everything at once!
 Yes! I did it!
 No good...
 The second I relaxed, it fell apart.
 But it works!
 If I can concentrate the aura
 from my Ren in one place,
 that'll be a lot of power.
 I want to test that power!
 Gon-kun, haste makes waste.
 Osu!
 He finally figured something out.
 You won't beat me, Gon!
 The two boys are about to
 undergo a new awakening.

 Yes.
 Right now, they should be
 spending every second training.
 Tell them we'll meet again.
 Sure.
 So long.
 Goodbye.
 Oh, one second...
 Look after Kurapika.
 He acts calm, but he can be rash.
 He's smart, but doesn't
 always think things through.
 It looks like he's opened up to you,
 so could you act as a brake?
 Yes.
 You're very soothing.
 You have the most pleasant
 heartbeat I've heard in this city.
 It's soft, expansive, and very warm.
 You would make an excellent
 doctor or teacher.
 You're well suited to such careers.
 I recommend a career change.
 Well, I'll think about it.
 I need to get serious about this...
 End x And x Beginning
 #16 has won Greed Island for 27.8 billion!
 Thank you very much!
 That bastard's serious
 about buying every copy.
 And he's aware of my budget.
 Only one copy left.
 Damn...
 I'm going to win this auction!
 What? He left?
 We'll see him again.
 He said to keep training hard.
 What? He didn't have to worry about that...
 Weren't you happy that Kurapika
 was leaving Yorknew City?
 Sure, but he left without telling us.
 Here.
 It's from Zepile.
 He said that you'll see him again.
 What?
 Zepile-san's gone, too?
 Yeah, and he recovered your
 hundred million, as promised.
 He really did...
 Now you can buy back
 your Hunter License.
 Yeah...
 Zepile-san really is special.
 Man, that Hunter License is a real gem.
 The pawn shop forked over a
 hundred million on the spot.
 In a proper auction, you could
 probably add two zeros...
 I know!
 I should become a pro Hunter
 so I can sell the license...
 I could live off the interest alone.
 And forget about debt!
 Okay, then let's get crackin'!
 And start prepping for the Hunter Exam!
 #16 wins Greed Island for 60.2 billion.
 Thank you very much.
 60.2 billion..
 That's insane.
 And he won all seven copies.
 But it cost him half of his wealth.
 Recently, an unknown party
 stole a copy of Greed Island
 won at auction for 30.5 billion by Mr. Battera.
 But, not to be discouraged, yesterday he
 won another copy for 27.8 billion,
 and another today for 60.2 billion.
 He must have some reason
 to go so far for this game.
 I've heard that upon clearing the game,
 you receive a treasure map.
 Or a giant dragon appears
 to grant your wish.
 All kinds of rumors are flying around.
 Thank you!
 I'm going home.
 Mr. Battera was able to acquire
 all the copies of Greed Island.
 He's also seeking players,
 but today's the deadline!
 There's already an amazing
 line outside the venue.
 I apologize for keeping everyone waiting.
 We will now begin selecting the players.
 As everyone already knows,
 you must be able to use Nen for this game.
 The test will proceed as follows.
 First, we need each applicant
 to demonstrate their Nen.
 We will then make our decision.
 The judge will be the
 pro Hunter, Mr. Tsezgerra!
 The Money Hunter Tsezgerra!
 If he's involved...
 This game must pay big dividends.
 Let us begin the test.
 One at a time, come up
 and show me your Ren.
 A shutter and curtain will block
 any view of the stage,
 so other applicants cannot
 see what's happening.
 The moment we've chosen thirty-two
 players, the test will end.
 Please step this way to take the test.
 That's our only explanation?
 Would the first applicant
 please step in.
 They only gave us a minimal explanation
 and left everything unknown.
 But the others are already moving
 like it's the natural response.
 They must know.
 Those guys aren't going to answer any questions.
 Our task is simple.
 Deduce all we can from the information
 provided, and then do our best.
 I'm certain they're judging
 us on the entire process.
 Approximately two hundred are in the hall.
 About a hundred have already lined up.
 At least fifty are watching from the sidelines.
 And twenty haven't moved an inch.
 Which group chose correctly?
 Next, please.
 Next.
 Something's wrong...
 Ten people have gone in,
 but no one's come out!
 Does that mean they all passed?
 This is bad.
 Should we get in line?
 Those guys are hopeless...
 They don't stand a chance.
 Huh?
 I'm talking about the ones still in
 line and those waiting nearby.
 Especially the ones
 standing next to the line.
 They're probably waiting
 for someone to return,
 so they can ask what's inside.
 If you did some research
 and used your head,
 you'd see there's no rush.
 In other words, you can't
 send in new players.
 That is why I must be careful
 when selecting players.
 I get it!
 This time, they aren't
 choosing thirty-two players!
 Exactly.
 It's been over ten years,
 and no one's cleared the game.
 And new players can't begin
 if old ones are still alive.
 Meaning that they have
 to save a few spots
 in case any extraordinary
 players appear.
 I'd guess they'll choose
 around twenty this round...
 Personally, I'd say that those in line
 or standing nearby have no shot.
 Anyone worthwhile either
 got in line at once,
 or figured out the trick and stayed in
 their seats to focus, like we did.
 Wouldn't you agree, kid?
 Gon?
 You realized what was going on?
 Well, it was just a hunch.
 I thought it was only natural that the hosts
 would want to test everyone here.
 That's true.
 You win, kid.
 Yeah, I'm impressed.
 Not many people can stick to their ideals.
 The steeper and more dangerous the path,
 the greater the need for both wit
 and ignorance to move forward.
 Next, please.
 My name is Puhat.
 Nice to meet you.
 People who act smart usually fail.
 He can hear you.
 But he's right.
 I was too focused on logically
 deducing the best method.
 I'm heading over.
 Yep, good luck.
 If I want to advance,
 I'll have to take risks.
 Because I've chosen a dangerous path!
 Listen to me... Never take risks.
 Act only when success is guaranteed.
 Otherwise, wait.
 Waiting is our most crucial job.
 If victory isn't assured, revealing your
 strength is the most foolish move to make.
 That's how my old man operates.
 But I'm no longer an assassin.
 I'm a Hunter!
 Let me see your Ren.
 Can I show you my Hatsu instead?
 That's fine.
 You're free to show me anything
 that demonstrates your power.
 Prove that the Ren I saw previously
 didn't represent your true power.
 Then, I'll get started.
 He changed his aura into electricity!
 In theory, it's certainly possible...
 But it's unbelievable
 that he learned this from
 scratch in four days!
 Well? Need to see more?
 No, that's enough.
 You pass.
 Yes!
 However, this technique could not
 have fully developed overnight.
 You'd require years of
 torturous training,
 exposing your body to strong electricity.
 Who are you?
 Strong electricity?
 From birth, I've been
 exposed to electricity.
 Family reasons.
 Seven people...
 That guy was right.
 The people who passed are those
 who moved immediately
 or waited in their seats.
 Well, I wonder if Gon will be okay.
 Gon.
 Killua!
 Good, you got chosen.
 Of course.
 Was that boom your doing?
 Uh-huh.
 Honestly...
 Those kids are scary.
 Well, allow me to congratulate you.
 The twenty-one people
 here have earned the
 right to play Greed Island.
 Upon clearing the game,
 you will receive 50 billion Jenny.
 The details are in the contract,
 so read and sign it before
 you depart at 5 PM.
 Cheers!
 You've made it past the first stage.
 Could you look at this for us?
 What is it?
 A contract?
 Looks like it can be summarized in three points.
 First, you can't file any claims
 if you're injured or die.
 Second, any items that you bring out
 of the game belong to Mr. Battera.
 Third, if you clear the game,
 you will receive a
 50-billion Jenny reward.
 I don't see any problems.
 Yep!
 So once you sign it, you're good to go.
 That second point seems important.
 ""Anything that you
 bring out of the game.""
 That's why he's paying the big bucks.
 Anything? Like what?
 I'm willing to hand it over.
 I'm not looking for items.
 I just want to get closer to Ging!
 See ya.
 Good luck on your exam, Leorio.
 Yeah, you guys be careful.
 Next time we see you,
 you'll be a doctor.
 Wouldn't that mean we won't see
 each other for at least four years?
 We plan to clear the
 game much more quickly.
 I don't intend to fall behind.
 Now, then...
 Before we begin, let me
 explain a few things.
 The individual game copies
 are not independent.
 It doesn't matter which
 console you start from.
 You will all arrive at the same place.
 Consider it a virtual area accessible
 from any spot on this planet.
 Fizz...
 I will now hand out memory cards.
 You will head immediately into the game.
 But first, we must decide the order.
 Order?
 Only one may enter the game area at a time.
 We will decide the order now,
 to forestall bickering inside the game.
 Then let's use rock-paper-scissors.
 Yes! I'm first!
 Oh?
 You're the boy who had a save file.
 Damn, I'm 17th!
 Do you want to use it?
 Don't worry.
 Your initial destination is
 always the same, regardless of your save.
 Ging...
 This game is a message from Ging to me.
 I'm going to trust him!
 I'll use my own card.
 Then put the ring on,
 and start the game.
 Gon.
 Wait in the starting
 area until I get there.
 Once you see a ""Now Playing"" message,
 the next person can begin.
 Welcome to Greed Island.
 You must be Mr. Gon Freecss.
 I will now explain how the game works.
 Would you care to listen?
 Sure.
 In this game, two magic spells are
 available to anyone wearing a ring:
 Book and Gain.
 Place the hand with the ring in
 front of you, and say, ""Book.""
 Book.
 In this game, your task is
 to collect certain cards.
 That book is for storing the
 cards you've collected.
 Please look at the first page.
 Each slot is labeled with a number.
 You can only place cards of the
 same number in these slots.
 These are your ""restricted slots.""
 Please flip ahead a few pages.
 Wait, there aren't any numbers!
 Yes, you may place any
 card inside these slots.
 These are your ""free slots.""
 There are 100 restricted slots,
 numbered 0 to 99.
 Then, you have another 45 free slots.
 To clear this game, you must
 fill the 100 restricted slots.
 I just need to collect a hundred cards?
 Yes.
 Specifically, you must
 transform one hundred items
 into cards and put them in your book.
 Transform them?
 For example, if you obtain a sword,
 it will become a card
 the moment you get it.
 If you wish to use a card as the item,
 you must use the spell ""Gain.""
 Gain...
 However, once you've used Gain to return
 a card to item form, you can never
 transform it into a card again.
 If you want to make it a card again,
 you must reacquire the item.
 Do you understand everything so far?
 Yeah, basically...
 There are two other cases in which
 you cannot transform
 an item into a card.
 The first is when you reach the item's
 maximum card transformation limit.
 Card transformation limit?
 Yes, every item in this game has
 a card transformation limit.
 For example, if an item has a
 transformation limit of three,
 and three players have already
 transformed the item into a card,
 the fourth to find it will be
 unable to change it into a card.
 In the second case...
 Huh?
 If you don't place the card into
 your book within one minute,
 it will automatically revert to an item.
 In this case, as well,
 you can never transform
 that item into a card again.
 Do you understand?
 Yeah, kinda...
 Finally, the most important note...
 I can't remember all of this...
 If a player dies,
 their book and ring are destroyed
 and the book's contents are lost.
 Does it matter anymore if you're dead?
 That concludes my explanation.
 You'll need to learn everything else
 about the game by playing it.
 Uh-huh, got it.
 Thanks.
 I wish you the best of luck.
 Please take those stairs.
 Loading save data.
 I have a message from Ging Freecss.
 From Ging?
 I'm glad to see you've made it, Gon.
 My friends and I made this game.
 Enjoy yourself.
 But if you expected a clue to my
 location, you're out of luck.
 I just wanted to show
 off this game to you.
 It doesn't matter what brought you here.
 Because you won't be able to leave
 until you obtain a specific item.
 So play away.
 Gon has finally stepped foot inside
 the legendary game Greed Island.
 A new adventure is about to begin.

 Regardless of who's watching, we should
 start by gathering information.
 So, how did it go?
 Hmm?
 Your save data.
 Book.
 How many cards were inside?
 There weren't any cards inside.
 Huh? For real?
 But there was a message from Ging.
 What did he say?
 To enjoy the game.
 Enjoy the game?
 But this doesn't really feel like a game.
 Book.
 What do you think about the rules?
 I still don't know enough yet.
 What was that?
 Was it Nen?
 This must be your first
 time playing this game.
 I wonder if you're right.
 Since you're carrying a book,
 you must be a player.
 Well, sure.
 You can't fool me.
 I know you're new to this game.
 Steal
 Reveal all free slots of
 one target player. (Can
 only be used on a player
 who's been encountered
 within the game.)
 [LR][NORM]
 I can use the Steal card.
 Casting Steal.
 Select target player.
 What is he doing?!
 Zefespa
 Grecoloas
 Killua
 Gon
 Killua-kun and Gon-kun, huh?
 How do you know our names?
 How indeed?
 You have zero chance if you don't
 know about the spell cards.
 View Killua's free slots?
 Yes      No
 No cards in Killua's free slots.
 Steal card was consumed.
 And that confirms it.
 They're total newbies who just arrived.
 And they're kids.
 Adhesion
 Complete data of one target
 player's restricted slots will
 be available at all times.
 (Effect lasts until player
 leaves the game.)
 [SR][ATK]
 I don't wanna waste this spell on them.
 Trace
 Current location of one
 target player will be
 available at all times.
 (Effect lasts until player
 leaves the game.)
 [SR][ATK]
 Trace should be good enough.
 Trace on!
 Attack, Killua!
 You can't run from spells in this game!
 Killua, are you okay?
 My attack worked!
 What did you just do to me?
 This kid's dangerous!
 Return
 Warp to a city
 of your choice.
 (Must be a city
 you have visited.)
 [LR][NORM]
 Return on!
 Take me to Masadora!
 Shizuku, Kortopi...
 Do you have a moment?
 Play the game?
 Yes, would you like to join me?
 Once we get home,
 there's nothing for us to do.
 You really want to clear this game?
 Actually, clearing it isn't my goal.
 Then this relates to Troupe business?
 More or less.
 Understood.
 Sure.
 Killua, how are you holding up?
 Hmm? I don't feel any different.
 But I'm still worried.
 He definitely did something to you.
 No point in worrying about it now.
 Hey, was he using Nen
 when he said, ""Trace on""?
 No, it's probably some magic
 that only works in the game.
 Magic? What kind?
 Beats me.
 Well, we'll find out eventually.
 Yeah.
 Look, there's a town!
 Welcome to Antokiba, City of Prizes
 Are those the prizes?
 Wow, all these are prizes?
 Looks that way.
 Oh, Killua...
 Look.
 ""Antokiba Monthly Tournaments Schedule.""
 There's a rock-paper-scissors
 tournament this month.
 September: Rock-Paper-Scissors
 Prize: Sword of Truth
 The prize is a Sword of Truth.
 Is that an important item?
 Probably.
 Look over there.
 And over there.
 Should we participate?
 Of course.
 Then let's try to win all kinds of prizes.
 We should also gather information.
 Welcome!
 If you can finish this within thirty
 minutes, you don't need to pay!
 In addition, you'll also receive
 a Galgaida as your prize.
 Galgaida
 One of the island's
 three greatest delicacies.
 Delicious, despite its
 appearance. The roe is
 said to extend your life.
 Good boiled or grilled.
 Okay, begin!
 Hey, chef.
 Do you know how to use magic?
 What's that?
 Who's the most knowledgeable
 person in this city?
 Knowledgeable? What's that?
 This guy doesn't know anything.
 He's probably just an in-game character.
 Oh, no! You did it!
 Here is your prize, Galgaida.
 ""1217.
 F-185.""
 What does that mean?
 Is this your first time seeing a card?
 Galgaida
 One of the island's
 three greatest delicacies.
 Delicious, despite its
 appearance. The roe is
 said to extend your life.
 Good boiled or grilled.
 The left number is the item's card number,
 and the sequence on the right
 ranks how difficult it is to obtain.
 There are ten ranks, from SS to H.
 F would be the third easiest.
 The number next to the rank is the item's
 maximum transformation limit.
 Oh, which means this item card...
 Is nothing but junk.
 I've never seen him around.
 That's brutal.
 He's one of the players who entered with us.
 Hey, what happened?
 His body suddenly exploded.
 From the inside.
 We've only been inside the
 game for a few hours,
 and someone's already dead.
 And this corpse has a very real presence.
 Hard to believe it's a game.
 We're risking our lives here.
 He disappeared?
 He probably went back to the real world.
 Game over.
 Hey, Killua.
 Was the magic used on you earlier...
 I don't know.
 Don't worry.
 There's no such spell in this game.
 Spell?
 As you just said, it's something like magic.
 He died from another player's Nen.
 Nen ?
 Does that mean the players are
 trying to kill each other?
 Why?
 Player hunting.
 Player hunting?
 I can explain later.
 Anyway, are you interested in teaming up?
 We know of a sure way to clear this game.
 Huh?
 If you're interested, follow me.
 My allies are waiting ahead.
 What do we do?
 Sounds suspicious.
 And we're already off to a bad start.
 As I recall,
 on your way here, another player
 used an attack spell on you.
 Have you been watching us?
 Yeah.
 And I wasn't the only one.
 Lots of people keep an eye
 on the starting point.
 If you come, I'll explain why.
 I can also tell you about the
 spell that was cast on you.
 You're being very nice.
 There must be a catch.
 We have no choice.
 This game is difficult,
 unpleasant, and frightening.
 Once you realize that,
 you'll be more willing to accept our offer.
 Well, it's your first time playing,
 so you could use the information...
 What makes you think it's our first time?
 We could be returning players.
 Book.
 This proves that you're beginners.
 An experienced player would react
 by summoning his own binder.
 Because you need spell cards
 to defend yourself.
 Then the spell cast on Killua...
 Could only be stopped by another card.
 Even when you aren't carrying any cards,
 you should still summon it.
 It's an important bluff.
 Book.
 Hey, how do we obtain spell cards?
 The easiest method would be to
 go to Masadora, City of Magic.
 Masadora?
 Return
 Warp to a city
 of your choice.
 (Must be a city
 you have visited.)
 [LR][NORM]
 Return on!
 Take me to Masadora!
 Killua, we should go with him.
 I'm worried about the spell on you.
 Okay?
 Sure...
 Is this everyone?
 Yeah.
 Everyone else turned me down.
 Let's get started, then.
 Another player was just killed.
 He arrived with the rest of you.
 His stomach exploded.
 It was the Bomber.
 The Bomber?
 The victims aren't killed by spells.
 No spell in this game is capable
 of injuring people.
 Which means that you won't be harmed or killed
 by any spell that's been cast on you.
 There are forty different spells.
 The one cast on you was an inspection spell.
 Either Trace or Adhesion.
 Trace
 Current location of one
 target player will be
 available at all times.
 (Effect lasts until player
 leaves the game.)
 [SR][ATK]
 In short,
 once the enemy uses these on you,
 Adhesion
 Complete data of one target
 player's restricted slots will
 be available at all times.
 (Effect lasts until player
 leaves the game.)
 [SR][ATK]
 he will then know everything about you.
 I get it.
 That's why...
 Some players wait near the starting point
 in order to cast these spells on new players.
 As soon as a player obtains a valuable card,
 they'll show up and steal it.
 In some cases, they kill their target.
 Like the guy who just died?
 I won't be that easy to kill.
 No, he was killed by something else.
 There is a violent faction hunting players.
 This was done by one of them...
 The Bomber.
 Bomber...
 In this game, there are three
 ways to acquire item cards.
 Do you know what they are?
 Find them yourself.
 Trade with other players.
 Steal them from other players.
 Yes, those are the three ways.
 However,
 the number of players stealing
 from others has recently increased.
 That's due to the card's difficulty to obtain
 and the card transformation limit system.
 Players who can't obtain cards themselves
 choose to take them from others.
 If those players resist, they're killed.
 When they die, their ring disappears,
 and their cards are lost.
 However, it increases the transformation
 limit of that type of card.
 If you kill a player, you can't take his cards.
 That rule was meant to keep
 players from killing one another.
 But now, it's backfiring.
 It's been over ten years since the game's release.
 If no one can find a way to beat it,
 the killing will only continue.
 That's why we're trying to end this mess.
 We're recruiting allies to clear this game.
 We need your help.
 How do you plan to obtain cards?
 1) Find them yourself.
 2) Trade for them.
 3) Steal them.
 Which method will you use?
 3...
 I assume you mean to use all three methods,
 but 3 will be the primary method.
 What, so you'll still use force?
 No!
 We won't use violence to reach our goal.
 Spells.
 You'll use spells.
 Am I right?
 Correct.
 There are certain spells for taking cards,
 and there are cards that
 defend against those spells.
 We'll focus on monopolizing these cards.
 We're going to use the very
 card transformation limit
 that's frustrated the players.
 This is the only way to clear the game.
 I have met many players, and they
 all reached the same conclusion.
 Even if you search for cards,
 they'll be taken from you eventually.
 Because this game is based on
 players taking cards from each other.
 We will ensure that we can take
 cards from other players,
 while mitigating our risk of losing cards.
 You're leaving out something important.
 Upon clearing the game,
 how will you split the reward?
 You were hired by Mr. Battera, right?
 So you knew who we were when you invited us.
 Yeah.
 Mr. Battera also hired us to play this game.
 That means the reward will be 50 billion.
 We'll split it among everyone who helps.
 Currently, we have fifty-three players.
 It'll take two months to collect
 the remaining spell cards,
 and one month to get the cards we need.
 We can finish in three months.
 Of course, if you join us,
 we'll remove any spells cast on you.
 I'm in.
 I don't like the idea of splitting the 50 billion.
 But I like the three month schedule
 for clearing the game.
 What about you?
 I have a question.
 If I obtain an SS rank card on
 my own, what's my cut?
 Naturally, you'd receive 500 million
 for a card of that rank.
 Okay, I'm in.
 What about you two?
 Killua, sorry.
 Hmm? What?
 I'm out.
 I'm playing this game on my own.
 You heard the leader.
 I have to pass.
 Hey, Gon! Wait up...
 What about you?
 We'll need you to first exit the game,
 so the spells placed on you can be removed.
 Once you're back in the game,
 wait by the starting point.
 We'll come get you.
 If you have any cards in your free slots,
 give them to me now.
 Why?
 When you leave the game,
 the cards in your free slots disappear.
 I believe your data automatically
 saves when cards are
 put in or removed from restricted slots.
 Yes, but your data disappears
 if you don't return within ten days.
 If you don't return before then,
 we'll assume that you gave up.
 Got it?
 Don't worry, we're being joined by an ally.
 We don't know if anyone's watching.
 Let's get started.
 Leave
 Send one
 target player
 off the island.
 [SR][NORM]
 I'll be using the Leave card.
 Hey, Gon...
 Will you explain what that was about?
 Sorry, Killua.
 I couldn't take it anymore.
 I still don't get why you're apologizing.
 But this means you'll be stuck
 with that spell for a while.
 Oh, that's why.
 It's not a big deal.
 But you're playing this game
 to help me find my dad...
 You're wrong.
 I'm playing this game because...
 Anyway, why were you so mad?
 Because they had nothing
 but bad things to say about
 the game Ging made, like how
 it's based on killing and stealing.
 I want to do what Ging said,
 and enjoy the game.
 When I first started,
 I knew it wouldn't be easy.
 That was because I thought all the
 players enjoyed playing the game.
 People have died.
 But it's the player mentality,
 not the game, that scares me.
 They're willing to hurt others to get cards.
 Really?
 I think it makes sense.
 Killua, you really mean that?
 That's why this game is meant for Hunters.
 But...
 Killing is wrong.
 I agree with you on that part.
 But what if two players have a fair
 fight with predetermined rules,
 and the winner gets to take a card?
 Th-That's acceptable.
 See?
 When that guy cast a spell on me
 and when those guys carry out their plan,
 they're just following the game's rules.
 Yeah.
 Though it does still feel lame.
 Well, forget about them.
 Let's enjoy this game.
 Killua...
 Hmm?
 Thanks.
 I'm glad you came with me.
 No...
 I'm glad I got to know you!
 Cut it out, stupid.
 You're embarrassing me.
 Why? I really mean it.
 You've got it backwards.
 Gon, I should thank you.
 I'm the one who's glad
 that I got to know you...
 I understand.
 So that's why.
 Such a beautiful thing, the friendship
 and innocence of two young boys.
 I feel like messing with them.
 Gon and Killua have
 reaffirmed their friendship.
 But who is the girl watching them?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Return.
 Return
 Warp to a city
 of your choice.
 (Must be a city
 you have visited.)
 [LR][NORM]
 This travel card lets you instantly warp
 to a city you've visited before.
 Return on!
 Mito-san's place.
 It only works for places inside the game.
 Huh?
 Continue!
 Next time: Reality x And x Raw.
 If you polish a raw diamond, you can make it shine!
 Hey, a shooting star!
 Shiny.

62,"Championship Finals, round 7!
 Ready...
 Go!
 First comes rock...
 Rock... Paper...
 Scissors!
 Killua wins!
 Yes!
 Congratulations.
 Here is your prize, the Sword of Truth.
 Look, Gon...
 Sword of Truth
 Sword that cuts through
 anything false. Has been
 used in trials to determine
 criminals. Breaks if used
 to cut something true,
 but will regenerate if left
 in scabbard for a day.
 This is card #83.
 It goes in a restricted slot.
 Okay, that's one down.
 Score!
 Reality x And x Raw
 The problem
 is how we protect the card.
 We don't have any defensive spell cards.
 Wait, kids!
 H-Hand over the Sword of Truth!
 Do as I say,
 and I won't be rough with you.
 No way, stupid.
 W-Wait!
 Book!
 Book!
 Hmph, you're bluffing.
 I know that you just started this game.
 You have no defensive spells,
 and all you would have in your restricted slots
 is the Sword of Truth.
 This is Thief!
 Thief
 Steal one random card
 from a restricted slot
 of one target player.
 [SR][ATK]
 This spell card lets you steal
 one random card from
 another player's restricted slots!
 Take this...
 Thief on!
 Attack Killua!
 Haven't you been training at all,
 Mister?
 Next time, I won't return your card.
 You must be an amateur.
 I'm impressed you got into a game for Hunters.
 But that was very educational.
 An attack spell won't kick in
 until you finish the chant.
 Th-That only works against weak players!
 Precisely.
 If you want a card,
 you take it from someone.
 Only fools would participate in tournaments.
 Understand, boys?
 I'm so pissed!
 Just forget it.
 Those guys were obviously pros.
 At least we didn't waste too much effort.
 Damn it!
 Then I'm gonna start getting spell cards!
 That means our next destination
 will be Masadora, City of Magic.
 No objections!
 That's our base.
 We'll begin assigning roles.
 You will collect spell cards for us.
 You've probably heard that there
 are forty different spell cards.
 We need you to obtain
 one of those cards, Prison.
 Prison
 All slotted cards on target
 page are immune to theft
 or destruction via spell
 card until removed from
 their slot. (Can only
 target pages 1 - 11.
 Free slot pages
 cannot be targeted.)
 [DEF][CONT]
 This is one of the strongest defensive spells.
 We could certainly use another one of these.
 In order to protect Breath of Archangel.
 Breath of Archangel?
 A super-rare SS card that no one's
 ever been able to obtain.
 How can you be certain no
 one's gotten one before?
 List
 Reveal number of card
 holders and number of
 cards for a target item.
 [LR][NORM]
 There's a spell card called List.
 When you cast it,
 you can learn the maximum
 transformation limit of any card
 as well as the number of current card holders.
 I see.
 The card is very difficult to obtain
 because you must have all forty spell
 cards before you can trade for one.
 But spell cards are extremely
 useful in this game,
 so players tend to use them up.
 However, we've been able
 to collect all forty spell cards.
 We would prefer to trade them in for
 a Breath of Archangel at once...
 But then you'd have no cards to protect it.
 That's why you need a copy of Prison.
 Exactly.
 At any rate, to carry out this plan,
 we'll need you all to memorize
 the forty different spell cards.
 Those four Galgaida cards
 netted us 120,000 Jenny.
 They were pretty valuable.
 We don't need to worry about money now.
 Let's buy some food and water,
 so we can start for Masadora!
 First, we'll need a map.
 Map of Island
 A blank map that
 automatically fills in
 locations as the owner
 visits and gathers
 information about them.
 Map of Island
 A detailed map
 showing cities
 and important
 locations, as well
 as useful information
 such as hot spots!
 The one with information costs 650,000,
 while the blank one is 20,000.
 Which one should we get?
 The 20,000 one.
 It'll be more fun to fill it in ourselves.
 You're so positive, it's painful.
 Gain.
 This doesn't tell us anything.
 Then let's ask.
 Head north for eighty kilometers.
 After you pass the mountain,
 you'll reach a lake.
 If you follow the lake north,
 you should reach Masadora.
 If we hurry, we can go
 eighty kilometers in a day.
 Yep.
 Assuming you survive.
 The mountain is crawling with bandits.
 And once you pass the mountain,
 you'll encounter hordes of monsters.
 Bandits?
 Monsters?
 Now it sounds more like an RPG!
 I wanna see these monsters!
 Let's hurry up!
 All right!
 Off we go!
 Please wait!
 I beg you!
 What?
 Please let me join you!
 Oh, sorry.
 Can't.
 Wh-Why not?
 You'd be a nuisance.
 Little brat...
 You dare call me a nuisance?
 If I chose to, I could mop the floor with
 you, with one hand behind my back.
 That does it.
 I was just going to tease these boys a little,
 but now I'm going to ruin their lives.
 Hey, hold it right there!
 Please!
 I'll try really hard not to get in your way!
 Okay, I have most of the information we need.
 Then, can you tell us what you found?
 All right. I'll start with number one.
 I tried a hundred different people in this city,
 and they all gave the same response
 when faced with an unusual question.
 This is typical behavior
 for in-game characters.
 Number two.
 Book.
 Rock
 A normal rock found
 on the ground.
 Does decent damage
 when thrown.
 This card is real.
 This one is a copy Kortopi made.
 Gain.
 Kortopi's card didn't transform.
 I believe that means the game's program
 didn't recognize Kortopi's card.
 Number three.
 Shizuku's vacuum works in this world,
 but it won't work on any items
 with special abilities.
 I think that's because the game was programmed
 so Nen couldn't be used to collect cards.
 So?
 However, the above three points
 indicate another possibility.
 This game isn't taking place
 in a virtual world.
 It's based somewhere in the real world.
 What do you mean?
 If the players actually entered the game,
 their spirits would detach from
 their bodies and enter the console,
 leaving the bodies behind.
 Sending them physically into the
 game would be unnecessary.
 And separating spirit from
 body should require more
 than standing before a console and using Hatsu.
 It's more logical that the players
 are actually warped elsewhere.
 Thus,
 Greed Island isn't a real game.
 It's a trap that sends players who
 use Hatsu here, to this island.
 That makes sense.
 But what does it mean?
 Do you remember the reward
 for clearing this game?
 Let's see...
 What was it?
 You can select three item cards
 from your restricted slots,
 to take back to the real world.
 Right.
 That means these items can
 be used outside the island.
 If this game takes place in the real world,
 it should be possible to remove
 the treasure without clearing the game.
 I understand.
 Book.
 At the moment, we only
 know about a few items.
 It would be ideal to learn all of the cards.
 So our first objective is
 the spell card God Eye.
 God Eye
 Grants the user the effects
 of Analysis and List on
 cards 001-099 at any time.
 (Effect lasts until player
 leaves the game.)
 [LR][CONT]
 Now we just need to find Phinks and Feitan.
 Another cheap map?
 But he was carrying a lot of spell cards.
 Well, let's split up for now.
 In one week, we'll meet in Masadora.
 It's a contest to see who
 can kill more players.
 Okay, be sure to take their cards first.
 Hey, what should we do about her?
 Just ignore her.
 Once the bandits show up,
 we'll have a chance to ditch her.
 Isn't that kind of mean?
 What are you talking about?
 Tsezgerra let her pass,
 so she must have strong Nen.
 She should be able to escape if it gets hairy.
 I didn't think she'd keep up this long.
 They have considerable physical strength.
 For a couple of kids, anyway.
 Let's take them.
 Yeah.
 Please help us!
 We beg you!
 Huh?
 A disease is going around the island.
 It starts with a mild fever,
 grows to a high fever, and
 eventually leads to death.
 All we can do is use medicine
 to keep the fever in check.
 But the medicine will only work for a week.
 It's also incredibly expensive,
 and we've run out of money...
 We've all fallen ill,
 so we're unable to do any bandit work.
 Is it contagious?
 That's just a scenario.
 My son only has two or three days to live!
 Could you spare us any money?
 This is an in-game event, right?
 Yeah, if we give them money,
 they should provide us with
 items or information.
 Uh, how much do you need?
 80,000 Jenny.
 That's all we have left.
 So they know everything about us.
 Um,
 I have enough to cover 80,000 Jenny.
 Ah, could you shut up for a moment?
 I'm gonna kill that brat.
 Got it.
 We can give you 80,000 Jenny.
 Really?
 Thank you so much!
 You've saved my son's life!
 I'm c-cold.
 So cold...
 Oh, no!
 If his body gets any colder,
 he'll die before we can
 get him the medicine!
 If only we had some children's clothes!
 Some children's clothes!
 Um, I can give him my clothes.
 That'd really be okay?
 You're like angels!
 Words are not enough...
 ...to express our gratitude!
 Nah, we don't need thanks.
 How about some information or items?
 We got nothing?
 We lost our clothes,
 and now we're totally broke.
 Damn, they're mocking us!
 What was that about?
 But once we get past this mountain,
 we'll find lots of monsters, right?
 Yeah.
 If we beat them and turn them into cards,
 we can sell them for lots of cash.
 We finally get to start fighting!
 Time to see what you've got.
 Ditto.
 I wanna see what you accomplished
 during your secret training.
 This area is rocky...
 Let's go!
 Yeah!
 There are tons of them!
 Gon's punch did no damage?
 So no amount of punching will take one down.
 And there are so many.
 In order to disable it with a single attack...
 Bingo! The eye is its weakness.
 Book.
 Gon, aim for the eye!
 Got it!
 They're moving around too much,
 but they're doing reasonably well.
 Weaker than they looked.
 The card reverted after we
 left it alone for a minute.
 We can do this.
 The monsters come with weaknesses.
 If we stay calm and think, we'll be fine.
 Okay.
 Let's head for Masadora, then.
 Yeah!
 Huh?
 Gon!
 I'm okay!
 That didn't hurt.
 This one's weak.
 But it's fast!
 Let's catch it.
 Damn!
 Watch the trajectory,
 not its current location.
 With observation, you can learn an
 opponent's pattern of motion.
 Your eyes are sharp, but you
 aren't using them properly.
 It got away from us.
 Well, it won't take very
 long to reach Masadora
 if they're all this weak.
 Don't be stupid!
 What if you encounter a monster
 that's both strong and fast?
 Bubbles?
 It's gone...
 It's loud and generates a shock wave,
 but it doesn't do any damage.
 When you touch them,
 the red ones don't pop.
 The white bubbles pop
 when they make contact with a human aura.
 The red ones pop when they make
 contact with anything else.
 To catch that horse, you must
 identify which bubble is which,
 then switch between Zetsu and Ten.
 That's still too difficult for them.
 Still...
 These boys are...
 These boys are just
 wasting their potential!
 They're raw stones that'll shine like
 diamonds with a little polishing!
 But at this rate, they'll run into
 stronger players or monsters,
 and it'll be game over!
 This one looks tougher.
 That's it...
 I've had enough!
 Gyo!
 Keep your eyes on it!
 Use Gyo!
 Don't you know how?
 See that?
 The armor's just a puppet,
 so attacks won't work against it.
 Here it is!
 I got the card!
 So you can use Gyo.
 Why didn't you use it before?
 Uh, well...
 Yeah...
 So you forgot.
 Why are you just standing there?
 Gyo!
 What do you see?
 The number 1.
 Good.
 Listen up.
 If I lift my finger, you use Gyo.
 And then you holler out what you see.
 If you ever sense anything suspicious, use Gyo.
 Got it?
 Wait, why are you ordering us around?
 The number 5!
 Correct.
 Drop and give me two hundred push-ups.
 Huh?
 It's your punishment!
 Get to it!
 What the hell? Why should I?
 Got a problem?
 You bet!
 Who do you think you are?
 Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet.
 I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.
 I first learned Nen forty years ago.
 I'm going to use my wealth of
 knowledge and experience
 to coach you boys.
 You should be grateful.
 Forty years ago?!
 You're an old hag!
 As it turns out, the young girl
 following Gon and Killua
 is a highly experienced pro Hunter.
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we'll introduce the card God Eye.
 God Eye
 Grants the user the effects
 of Analysis and List on
 cards 001-099 at any time.
 (Effect lasts until player
 leaves the game.)
 [LR][CONT]
 That's the card Shalnark wants.
 If you use this spell, you get
 a description of a given card,
 number of holders, and total
 number of cards in existence.
 I want one!
 Continue!
 Next time: A x Hard x Master.
 My master is Wing-san!
 My master is—
 P-Pow!

63,"I'm the pro Hunter Biscuit Krueger.
 I'm not big on formalities,
 so call me Bisky.
 In return, you must obey every
 word of what I teach you.
 No way. And no, thanks.
 We're not desperate enough to beg
 a total stranger to train us!
 Say something, Gon.
 We have Wing-san.
 Right, right.
 We already have a master,
 and we don't need anyone else to teach us.
 Wing?
 You mean that little boy with
 messy hair and glasses?
 The one who never tucks in his shirt?
 Do you know him?
 Do I know him?
 Wing's one of my students.
 Seriously?
 That's awesome!
 So he's become a master now...
 Time really flies, huh?
 Does that mean you're pro Hunters?
 Oh, just me.
 You've passed the secret exam?
 Yep.
 That really takes me back...
 I'd love to serve as an examiner again.
 Well, I'm essentially your master's master,
 so you shouldn't have any
 problems with my teaching you.
 A x Hard x Master
 Wow!
 You've been an examiner!
 Assuming that she's telling the truth.
 You're a stubborn little boy.
 I like to see that in kids.
 You said that you weren't desperate, right?
 Book.
 That card...
 Marimo-chi
 A super-fast ball-like
 creature about as hard
 as rubber. Deals little
 damage, but can be
 annoying if it smacks
 you in the face.
 Look carefully.
 Its difficulty to obtain is ranked D.
 It's a normal card that doesn't
 go in a restricted slot.
 The problem is that
 there are many people who
 could have effortlessly
 obtained this card, while you two could not.
 If you run into someone who's
 stronger and has evil intentions...
 Sit down...
 Pretend that we're chatting.
 There's an enemy behind me.
 Three kids?
 I'll cut them apart.
 Don't probe for him.
 He'll notice.
 How did you sense him?
 He let a tiny bit of bloodlust escape.
 The enemy saw a bunch of kids,
 and he relaxed for a second.
 Doesn't that mean he's weak?
 He immediately concealed his presence again.
 It was only the slightest bloodlust,
 and he quickly concealed it,
 so he's pretty good.
 We couldn't even sense his presence,
 let alone locate him.
 What should we do?
 He's fast on the uptake!
 This boy's bright.
 What do you think?
 We three should move together.
 Why do you say that?
 I'm guessing he decided to use caution
 because there are three of us.
 If we stick together,
 he'll be less eager to attack.
 I agree.
 Well, you're right.
 But that's not what we're going to do.
 If I go off on my own,
 the enemy is one hundred percent
 guaranteed to attack me.
 I'll go south. You boys, go north.
 Walk five hundred meters without
 concealing your presences.
 Aim for that pillar.
 Once you get there, use Zetsu,
 then rush back immediately!
 Okay, stalk the stalkerâ€”
 Huh?
 Fine, then! Be that way!
 Damned hag...
 I've had enough!
 Bye-bye.
 Yeah, get lost!
 We didn't want you around!
 Come on, Gon!
 Let's go.
 Oh, they're acting.
 So long, stupid!
 That woman really is something.
 Huh?
 I was on full alert,
 so I'd be ready to react at a moment's notice.
 But I didn't realize what she'd done
 until my cheek began to sting.
 Let's hurry back.
 Yeah.
 I just cut your hair...
 With my Scissor Hands!
 When I eat the hair I cut,
 I can learn things about the owner's body
 that they don't even know about themselves.
 Muscle tone, potential for
 disease, genetic strengths!
 I will learn everything about your body
 before I begin to toy with it...
 Age fifty-seven?!
 And she looks like this?
 What's even scarier is how honed her body is.
 I can see
 her physical appearance conceals
 the strength she's achieved
 through intensive training.
 My fighter's spirit insists that
 I challenge you to a duel.
 I guess you aren't a total deviant.
 Very well.
 You're lucky.
 If I'd used my Nen, you would be dead.
 During that battle, what did you see first?
 The guy being flipped through the air.
 Same here.
 Her opponent wasn't weak by any means.
 She's just that strong!
 If he were an in-game character,
 he'd have a D rank in terms of difficulty.
 It would have been an instant
 game over for you boys.
 That makes the second time
 I've seen you barely escape death.
 How long will your good fortune last?
 Bisky-san...
 Just call me Bisky.
 If you insist on an honorific,
 call me Bisky-chama!
 I'll just call you Hag.
 Why are you here, Bisky?
 Well, I'm here to clear the game,
 but I'm mainly after a jewel.
 A jewel?
 There's a jewel that can only be found here.
 Blue Planet
 A gemstone with an
 incomparable blue shine.
 Its composition matches
 no known minerals,
 so it's named for its
 otherworldly nature.
 It goes in restricted slot #81...
 Blue Planet.
 What about you boys?
 We're here to clear the game, obviously.
 Actually, my dad made this game.
 Oh?
 I'm looking for my dad,
 so I thought this game might contain a lead.
 Who's your dad?
 Ging Freecss.
 Ging?!
 You know him?
 You bet I do!
 He's famous.
 Chairman Netero once said
 he was one of the top five Nen users...
 Bisky, if you'd be willing to
 postpone your treasure hunt,
 please teach us Nen!
 You've finally come around?
 I'm a lot tougher than Wing.
 Are you ready?
 Yes!
 What about you?
 I'll be fine.
 Take out all your cards.
 Book.
 I'm going to give you a chance.
 You must evade their attacks for two weeks!
 If you're successful, I'll let you escape.
 If you're knocked unconscious or can't stand...
 I will kill you.
 I just have to avoid their attacks, right?
 It doesn't matter what I do to them?
 Sure.
 But there's one rule.
 You aren't allowed to leave this crater.
 If you break this rule, you lose,
 and I'll kill you.
 What about us?
 The same rules apply.
 If you leave, or fail to defeat
 him after two weeks,
 you'll be punished.
 You're the Bounty Hunter Binolt, right?
 Yeah.
 There's a bounty on his head, as well.
 He's a brutal murderer.
 Begin!
 Why are you standing around?
 He's trying to heal up!
 Are you going to let him?
 If he weren't injured,
 I would have lost my eye!
 We can't get close to him...
 Should I use this?
 But while I charge up, he won't stay still.
 Gon, let's make this a battle of attrition.
 Attrition?
 You get some rest.
 I'll keep an eye on him, and use these to attack.
 We'll switch every six hours.
 Rocks?
 That's a good idea.
 That's exactly what I need...
 If I can rest like this for a week,
 I'll be more or less recovered.
 Once I'm healed, I can finish them off.
 He's using the rock as a shield!
 Correct!
 You boys can't beat him in a drawn-out fight.
 Makes sense.
 Damn!
 They have too much stamina!
 I won't have any time to rest!
 Binolt may be injured,
 but making him uncomfortable
 in half a day is still impressive.
 They're conscious that their lives
 are on the line in this fight.
 Not bad at all.
 These boys are raw gems!
 That rock-hard conviction in his eyes.
 That hidden, bottomless potential.
 If properly cut through training,
 he can be completely transformed...
 Like a diamond!
 And this boy is a cool, calm blue.
 He may look fragile,
 but with the right amount of heat, he can
 achieve semi-permanent strength...
 Like a sapphire!
 Why does my heart skip
 whenever I see something
 waiting to be polished?
 I'll train them well!
 What?
 A forest of rocks.
 It impedes their enemy,
 while concealing their presences.
 This won't take two weeks.
 They'll finish it in a day.
 Game over, pops!
 Stop, Killua!
 Why did you stop me, Gon?
 We still have plenty of time.
 Let's continue until we're both
 able to take him alone.
 Huh?
 Stopping now would be a waste.
 Because we're on a roll.
 Fool...
 It's my turn.
 I'll slice you up!
 Sure, but let's wait until tomorrow.
 You should get some rest.
 You've been slowing down.
 True.
 If it takes both of us to beat a single
 injured, exhausted man,
 we won't stand a chance
 against any of the rest.
 You won't be able to fool their
 acute antennae now.
 Binolt, your potential pales
 in comparison to theirs.
 Oh, my wallet's missing.
 Really? You had it a moment ago.
 Excuse me...
 You dropped this...
 Day two...
 He's slowing down.
 No, we're getting faster.
 Practice pays off that much more
 when you're fighting an equal for your life.
 Damn...
 Damn!
 I never...
 I never wanted
 to live this way!
 That's why I was against this!
 You're the one who said
 this would be a shortcut.
 Now it's my fault?
 Look at my clothes...
 They're dirty now.
 I wasn't looking for a reward...
 I wasn't expecting any gratitude...
 I just...
 That's enough.
 There's no way I can defeat you.
 Kill me.
 Why? We won't kill you.
 You've helped us make a lot of progress.
 Thank you, Binolt-san!
 I only wanted
 to lead a normal life.
 Go on.
 Once I leave, I'll turn myself in.
 Gon...
 You're flawless,
 a perfect gem.
 But that pure nature could be your undoing.
 Well, let's head for Masadora.
 Osu!
 The number 9!
 Too slow!
 Give me three thousand push-ups.
 Damn...
 Masadora's about seventy kilometers away.
 That's a three-hour trip, at most.
 Seriously?
 Oh, there it is!
 City of Magic
 Masadora
 Let's find a department store now!
 They're only selling cards...
 Sorry for the wait.
 Let's return to that rocky area.
 What?!
 Gain!
 These are the cards you bought?
 Yep.
 We'll head back to Masadora now.
 However,
 we'll go in a straight line!
 Huh? A straight line?
 You can't mean...
 Yep!
 It's time to dig!
 The rock isn't as hard as I was expecting.
 Yeah, this should go pretty smoothly.
 This is rough...
 No more...
 Hold on.
 If you're going to rest, sit properly.
 Huh?
 Starting today, you must always
 sleep in this position.
 Don't let go of the rope.
 There's a chance I might cut the rope,
 so keep a portion of your
 brain alert while you sleep.
 My old man put me through this
 kind of training all the time.
 Ow!
 Okay, when it falls,
 you have to put it back up.
 Gon, your head...
 I'm good...
 I'll be making them bigger.
 Gon...
 I'm good!
 Ow!
 We've run into a really hard rock.
 Can we dig it up?
 I don't think a shovel will work.
 I can probably break it with a Nen punch.
 What's wrong?
 Killua, what were you doing with
 your aura while digging?
 I wasn't doing anything unusual.
 Think of the shovel as part of your body!
 I see.
 If we shroud the shovel in aura,
 our digging will be stronger!
 Wow! The rock's as soft as pudding!
 Okay! Let's keep on digging!
 They've learned a new application of Ten, Shu!
 Surround
 Once we reach Masadora,
 they'll have completed the first stage.
 How will Bisky's grueling training
 transform the two boys?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we're introducing the card Blue Planet.
 Blue Planet
 A gemstone with an
 incomparable blue shine.
 Its composition matches
 no known minerals,
 so it's named for its
 otherworldly nature.
 It's one of the reasons Bisky is playing the game.
 She's going through all this just for a stone?
 That hag has weird taste...
 Continue!
 Next time: Strengthen x And x Threaten.
 Strengthen!
 Ahem!
 Don't threaten!
 Ahem!

64,"All right!
 We made it through!
 Good work!
 I think we've gone five kilometers today.
 At first, I thought it would take years,
 but at this pace...
 Masadora!
 Take two!
 Okay!
 Let's return to the starting point now.
 Again?!
 Strengthen x And x Threaten
 Next, we'll work on obtaining monster cards.
 You have the requisite physical strength
 to defeat every enemy here.
 What you lack
 is the ability to come up with
 a plan of attack as you fight.
 In other words, the ability to strategize.
 The ability to...
 ...strategize.
 I'm not going to say a single word,
 so devise your own means
 to defeat the monsters.
 Still, the people who made this
 game really were special...
 The game's programmed in such a way
 that you're guaranteed to get
 stronger as you progress.
 And, most likely, all for the purpose
 of making him stronger.
 Yes!
 I got the Marimo-chi!
 Nen battles require one to fight
 against many different enemy types.
 The ability to think on your feet
 is the most critical technique.
 First, get used to thinking all the time,
 until your thinking is tied to your reflexes.
 This game is a training program
 to help you achieve that.
 The hardest monster in this
 area is the Bubble Horse.
 If they clear that hurdle,
 they'll complete the second stage!
 Zetsu!
 Caught it!
 I got a Bubble Horse!
 Way to go.
 Yep!
 When it comes to analysis and
 physical strength, Killua's stronger.
 But Gon makes up for it with his
 concentration and recovery speed.
 They make a perfect team!
 Okay, we'll now begin to
 work on your defense.
 Is that...
 That's right, Gon.
 This is the technique you've been using.
 Ten
 Ten, Zetsu, Ren, Hatsu, and Gyo
 Zetsu
 Ren
 Hatsu
 Gyo
 are combined in this technique.
 Ko!
 Ko
 You focus all of your aura into one
 part of your body, then attack.
 This gives it far greater power
 than your regular attacks.
 I'm going to attack with my fist.
 You must block my attacks.
 You may not dodge.
 You've figured it out?
 That's right...
 If you use your aura to block normally,
 you'll take considerable damage.
 So what should you do?
 We should use Ko, too.
 You're half right.
 Ko against Ko.
 As long as you and your opponent
 are similar in Nen capacity,
 you'll escape unscratched.
 However...
 If your opponent hits you in a place
 where you weren't using Ko,
 you'll be destroyed.
 Then we should use Ko on our entire body.
 Though it's contradictory.
 Exactly.
 This technique combines Ten and Ren.
 Ken.
 Ken
 You defend yourself
 by shrouding your body in
 much more aura than usual.
 It isn't as strong as Ko,
 but it's far more practical.
 Gon, use Ren.
 To sustain that for a prolonged
 period is called Ken.
 Now protect yourself from my punch!
 So slow.
 You must have relaxed when you
 saw how slowly I was moving.
 If you'd stopped using Ken,
 your face would have been smashed.
 That was the power of Ko alone.
 When I add the speed and power
 packed by a normal punch,
 it becomes many times stronger.
 Even dozens of times stronger.
 I'll start by going slowly,
 but you won't get any warning.
 Keep using Ken, and try to
 withstand my attacks.
 Gon!
 Hmm, that was almost two minutes...
 I had no idea it could be this
 hard to keep up my Nen.
 You need to be able to sustain
 Ken for at least thirty minutes,
 or you won't stand a chance.
 Okay, we're through!
 Learning to use Ken!
 Good, that was thirty minutes!
 Over the past month,
 you've become a lot tougher.
 The number 3!
 Bingo!
 Killua was slightly faster.
 Gon, give me a thousand push-ups.
 Okay, we'll begin actual
 combat training today.
 Ken!
 In your current state, your attack
 power is 50, defense 50.
 So if you fight each other while using Ken,
 you won't be able to deal much damage.
 What should you do?
 Use Ko!
 You fool.
 What if he hits you where
 you aren't using Ko?
 Use Gyo?
 Correct!
 From your current 50-50 state,
 at the moment of attack,
 you shift your fist to 70 POW,
 and the rest to 30 POW.
 You can use Gyo to alter your POW
 depending on the situation.
 This is Ryu!
 Ryu
 Let's get started...
 Right hand to 70 POW,
 rest of your body to 30 POW!
 It doesn't have to be precise, so try it out.
 Left leg to 80 POW,
 rest of your body to 20 POW!
 Head to 60 POW,
 rest of your body to 40 POW!
 Do this for thirty minutes, three times a day.
 Add it to your current training menu.
 Also...
 We'll begin sparring now.
 Use Ryu the way I just taught you.
 You can start out slow.
 When you're on the defensive,
 determine your opponent's attack power
 before defending with Ryu.
 With that said...
 Begin!
 I'll go first, then.
 Right leg, 55 POW.
 Right leg, 60 POW, I think...
 Left hand, 60 POW.
 Right fist, 80 POW!
 Left elbow, 80 POW!
 If they keep this up daily, for two months,
 they'll be able to fight at
 full speed while using Ryu.
 After that, it'll be time for the final stage.
 Okay!
 Time for a break!
 Thank you very much!
 Osu!
 It's been two weeks.
 They've made a lot of progress...
 It appears you're ready for the final stage.
 The final stage?
 Yes, you will begin training in
 the individual categories.
 3!
 Bingo!
 A draw.
 You're free to train solely in your own category.
 In the case of an Enhancer...
 Enhancer
 Mani.           Emit.          Enha.         Tran.         Conj.
 You'd want to focus on your Enhancer skills,
 while training the nearby categories
 of Transmuter and Emitter in a balanced fashion.
 Then you'll master your own category faster.
 9!
 Bingo!
 A draw.
 Good job, Killua.
 Same to you.
 Then, let's get started.
 Osu!
 Today, we'll be training in
 the Enhancer category.
 Level 1 is smashing rocks.
 Crush them like this.
 Smash a thousand with a single stone
 in a day, and you clear the level.
 And begin!
 This is pretty tough.
 All I'm doing is
 changing the stone to 100 POW
 at the moment of impact.
 But my Nen is weakening as I go.
 Oops, it crumbled...
 If the stone in your hand breaks, it's over.
 Damn!
 Damn, I failed!
 What are you talking about?
 You did well.
 Okay!
 Let's do Transmuter training next.
 Now, now, don't rush.
 You're only allowed to train
 one category per day.
 6!
 Bingo! A draw.
 Again?
 These days, we keep getting draws.
 That just shows that you've both
 grown accustomed to using Gyo.
 But if there's no winner, it's no fun.
 Okay, then we'll decide
 with rock-paper-scissors.
 The loser does a thousand push-ups!
 Sure.
 First comes rock...
 Rock, paper, scissors!
 One more time!
 I win!
 Damn!
 Hey, boys...
 Have you heard the theory that
 rock-paper-scissors began in martial arts?
 Huh?
 Palm
 Paper represents a palm attack that
 wrecks the opponent's organs.
 Fingers
 Scissors represents a finger jab,
 targeting vital points.
 Fist
 And rock represents a punch with
 the fist to deal external damage.
 Evil Fist
 Long ago, when martial arts were mistaken
 as purely destructive and banned as an evil art,
 martial artists trained by playing this game.
 And that's how rock-paper-scissors came to be.
 You really are old...
 That's it!
 Eh?
 Evil Fist.
 Now, everyone.
 We have a total of 133 cards from
 90 of the 100 total restricted slot cards.
 This is the product of your hard work.
 You have our thanks.
 Of the remaining 10 cards, we've located 7.
 They're as good as ours.
 However, Tsezgerra's group has also obtained
 an equal number of restricted slot cards.
 The final hurdle will likely be a
 showdown against their group.
 But I believe we have more,
 and better, spell cards!
 Gentlemen, our victory is near!
 Can I say something?
 These five years have been
 so long, yet so short...
 There's something I must tell you.
 I am the Bomber.
 What? The Bomber?
 H-Hey, what are you talking about?
 Now, now... Hear me out.
 I've placed bombs on all of you.
 What was that?
 How did you do that?!
 Don't mess with us!
 Stay calm and listen.
 Good grief.
 You ruined the explanation I'd planned.
 This is my power...
 Little Flower.
 Fistful of Gunpowder
 Little Flower
 As you just saw,
 I can blow up anything I grab with my hand.
 But it isn't very strong.
 He's still alive.
 However,
 if the bombs on your bodies explode,
 you will die.
 A bomb? Where is it?
 I will now tell you how to disarm the bombs.
 Let's start with how I set them.
 That was by touching the place on
 the target I wanted to explode,
 and saying a certain keyword.
 The keyword is
 ""Bomber.""
 It was the Bomber again.
 Listen... Beware of the Bomber.
 In order to disarm the bombs,
 you must touch my body and say,
 ""I caught the Bomber.""
 However, I also have the Little Flower ability.
 I can use this to stop anyone
 who tries to touch me.
 You must be very careful as you
 attempt to disarm the bombs.
 That's all.
 They're armed.
 This is the ability Countdown.
 Sound of Life
 Countdown
 Why am I telling you so
 much about my powers?
 That's the condition for arming the bombs.
 Then you've been waiting for
 the day when all the cards
 and members were gathered.
 Now, I have a proposition.
 I will trade your lives for those
 90 restricted slot cards.
 If you agree, I will use an alternative method,
 and simultaneously disarm all the bombs.
 Do nothing, and all of you will die
 when the counter reaches zero.
 You should discuss this amongst yourselves.
 I'll be waiting for you at
 Mr. Battera's old mansion.
 I don't care who comes, but come alone.
 Are you insane?
 If we just catch you now and
 disarm the bombs, it's all over.
 Do you think you can escape alone?!
 Calm yourselves...
 If you get too excited,
 the countdown will accelerate.
 Because the counter is linked
 to your heartbeat.
 What?
 Book!
 Crap!
 I pray we meet again!
 Leave
 Send one target player
 off the island.
 [SR][NORM]
 Leave on!
 He escaped outside the game!
 We have to follow him...
 Wait!
 If we leave, the cards inside
 our binders will vanish!
 Then what do we do?
 Calm down!
 It would be unwise to chase him down!
 Have you forgotten why we teamed up?
 Because we aren't strong fighters!
 Does anyone here think they're
 strong enough to defeat him?
 It would be impossible.
 Given his Nen abilities, he must be powerful.
 If all of us attacked him together,
 he could use Little Flower to defeat us all.
 Damn, we were so close!
 First, we must reach a consensus.
 Do we hand over the cards?
 Or do we fight?
 Please give him the cards...
 I beg you.
 Jispa's running out of time...
 That's a surprise.
 I was expecting Nickes to come.
 I'm surprised, too.
 I didn't expect you to be alone...
 Sub and Bara.
 They're the other bombers.
 Now give me your ring.
 What's wrong?
 I can't turn it over yet...
 Actually, we still haven't reached a decision.
 And Nickes has requested the Breath
 of Archangel card to save Jispa.
 Screw that!
 As it stands, neither side can win this!
 Eh?
 You don't realize how hysterical they are.
 If they can't make a decision before
 time expires and they explode,
 you'll lose the data in their rings!
 But I can—
 But you can convince them?
 Are you trying to bargain with me?
 When striking a bargain,
 you have to demonstrate just
 how calm and insane you are.
 W-Wait...
 If you kill me...
 Don't worry.
 If you kill a player outside the
 game and take their ring,
 the restricted slot data will not vanish.
 Well, I doubt you have any of the cards.
 A gift.
 Puhat!
 You won't get another chance.
 Okay?
 Leave...
 The spell card! Leave!
 I need to exit, so give it to me.
 Hell, no!
 Leave is a valuable card.
 We can't waste any!
 Okay, then...
 If I don't return,
 it won't be possible to disarm all
 your bombs simultaneously.
 What?
 I'm also a bomber.
 There are three of us.
 Well, Genthru's the main one,
 and we're just extras.
 When the three of us join our
 right thumbs and say the keyword,
 the bombs will be destroyed.
 That's the alternative method.
 Whatever...
 I'll take my time returning
 via normal means.
 You guys will be dead soon.
 Wait! Hold on!
 Please use this.
 You should have done that
 in the first place, scum!
 We'll need Leave cards
 when the deal is made.
 Have three ready.
 Got it?
 Twelve hours before Genthru
 revealed himself as the Bomber,
 a single boat attempted to
 invade from the outside.
 So it does exist in the real world.
 That's gotta be Greed Island.

 Uninvited guests?
 I'm getting nervous...
 Just so we're clear,
 you didn't wash up on shore, right?
 After all, if you'd let the waves carry you,
 it would be impossible to reach this island.
 This guy's strong.
 Who are you?
 Are you supposed to be our tour guide?
 I'm one of the designers of this game.
 The name's Razor.
 I mainly handle the Emitter spells,
 including all movement via spells
 and dealing with external threats.
 Eliminate
 Send all trespassers
 on Greed Island to a
 random location on
 the Azian continent
 [LR][SP]
 This is a special spell only usable by Game Masters.
 Sorry, but you'll have to leave.
 You're more than welcome to
 visit via official channels.
 From there, if you defeat me,
 you can receive an item.
 Should you decide to play,
 we'll probably get to fight eventually.
 Sounds good...
 We'll come back.
 Through the front door.
 Eliminate on.
 Hmm, those were some strong Nen users...
 Evil Fist x And x Rock-Paper-Scissors
 As Gon continues to train,
 he discovers a hint to developing
 a new technique, and that is...
 First comes rock!
 Rock... Paper...
 Rock!
 I see.
 Here comes the next one!
 First comes rock!
 Rock... Paper...
 Paper!
 Bisky, how do I make my Nen fly?
 Train more!
 So paper is an Emitter technique?
 Uh-huh.
 And Scissors is a Transmuter technique.
 I wanna be able to cut through rock.
 I understand.
 That's a reasonable fighting technique.
 But such a childish idea.
 You know how it takes time
 to focus Nen in my fist?
 I was trying to think of a good
 way to spend that time.
 And when you were talking about
 rock-paper-scissors, it hit me.
 Because I like rock-paper-scissors.
 Trusting your instincts is important.
 Your gut plays a big role in
 techniques that require
 multiple Nen categories.
 The key is that it should feel right to you.
 Ah... Ahem.
 Well, this is all I can manage right now,
 but if I charge it up, it's pretty strong.
 That's awesome, Killua!
 You're like an electric eel!
 That's a horrible comparison!
 He can already change Nen into
 electricity at such a young age?
 Frightening...
 And very tragic...
 His childhood must have been a living hell.
 It's a miracle that he can smile now.
 Indeed...
 They make a great team.
 Well, let's take a break, then.
 It's a little early, but we can have a party.
 A party?
 What do you boys do back home to celebrate?
 Celebrate?
 In the outside world, it's almost New Year's.
 Time flows at the same speed
 inside the game as outside.
 Oops!
 The deadline to apply for the
 Hunter Exam is coming up!
 And our training was just starting to get fun...
 I believe you're required to apply
 before the end of the year.
 We need to hurry.
 How do we get outside?
 I'm guessing there are spell
 cards to leave the game?
 In that case, let's head to Masadora.
 Agreed!
 Well, let's find a place to have a drink.
 We can't... There's no time.
 We can ask around the stores.
 How to leave the island?
 That'll be 3,000 Jenny.
 If you go about fifty kilometers west,
 you'll reach the island's only port.
 You must defeat or bribe
 the chief of that port
 to receive a ticket that will
 transport you outside.
 How big of a bribe are we talking?
 Depends on how the chief's feeling.
 Ah...
 Your other option is to
 use a Leave spell card,
 but that's a rare one.
 What do we do?
 Let's head for the port.
 If it's a rare card, we could buy
 a bunch without finding one.
 True.
 Passage Ticket
 Voilà.
 Well, I'll go pass the test real
 quick, and then hurry back.
 There are monsters called Kiriko
 that live beneath a cedar tree
 on the mountain behind Dolle Harbor.
 If you tell them you're my friend,
 they'll take you to the exam area.
 Okay.
 See ya.
 Then let's get back to training.
 Osu!
 Welcome.
 Is this where I started?
 No, it's not...
 The girl looks similar, though.
 Well, that's not so unusual in games.
 You are leaving the island, right?
 Please select a destination.
 Do you know Dolle Harbor?
 Yes, I do.
 Then send me there.
 Understood.
 When you leave this island,
 the cards in your free slots will disappear.
 Is that okay?
 Yeah, it's fine.
 Then we shall await your return.
 I'm back in the real world now?
 Doesn't feel that way.
 Book.
 Oh, it doesn't work out here.
 Once I submit my application,
 I'll head for that cedar tree.
 First, I should shower and
 change into fresh clothes.
 Okay, train while you run!
 When you can form the numbers from 0 to 9
 in one minute, you'll clear this stage.
 That hurt!
 What are you doing?
 Aren't you...
 Your other friend isn't here?
 What's that machine on your shoulder?
 Did something happen?
 We were fooled by the Bomber.
 Will you listen to my story?
 So he was the Bomber...
 The others are waiting at our base for
 the Bomber to disarm the bombs.
 They believe the terms he gave them,
 even though it was probably a bluff.
 Can't anything be done?
 If they're prepared to accept casualties...
 It's impossible.
 The first people to attack
 will be the ones who die.
 Who would volunteer for that role?
 True...
 Jispa was our group's strongest fighter,
 and he was defeated in an instant.
 At that point, our loss was assured.
 And allowing him to leave the game
 was a fatal mistake.
 We indulged in a moment's victory cheer
 before we could verify each
 member's cards and assign roles.
 That's when he caught us off guard.
 It's embarrassing to admit,
 but I was so distracted,
 I didn't notice him using Leave
 until it was already too late.
 You were probably focused on
 understanding his explanation.
 Yeah.
 We were thrust into that
 situation with no warning.
 Given our mental state, there was
 no action we could have taken.
 But why are you telling us this?
 Because, of everyone I've met on this island,
 you are the ones I believe I can most rely on.
 If you run into any other players,
 please tell them about the Bomber.
 Once everyone knows how his ability works,
 they should be able to protect themselves.
 And if possible, I would
 like you to avenge us!
 If not,
 could you at least promise that
 you won't let him clear the game?
 Yeah.
 Understood.
 Sorry...
 I'll use what time I have remaining
 to tell as many as I can about the Bomber.
 Book.
 Return on.
 Bunzen!
 Just kidding...
 The truth is that they were
 the only players I could find
 using Magnetic Force.
 Even a pig can climb a tree if
 you give it enough praise.
 Every thousandth of a percent counts
 when it comes to deactivating someone's Nen.
 Well, Nickes probably left to
 meet with the bombers.
 If the mass disarmament
 turns out to be a mass explosion...
 I should get started.
 You're finally here.
 Now give me your ring.
 Jispa's dead.
 That's nice. Your ring.
 Disarm everyone's bombs first!
 Hell, no.
 I have to enter the game with your ring,
 and confirm that the cards
 really are all inside.
 I'll disarm the bombs after that.
 I'll give you one more chance.
 Hand over the ring.
 Sub, put it on.
 If you put on a second ring outside the game,
 you'll overwrite the data.
 Now, let's head back inside together.
 Wait, what was your name?
 Migamura, Samingadura,
 Interaminga, Zenberarubura.
 Spirits of the forest,
 remove the tainted Nen that resides within me.
 Now, then...
 What horrors will come of this?
 I borrow power from the forest spirits,
 to use my Conjurer ability
 to create a Nen beast, capable of
 consuming other people's Nen!
 It's huge!
 The Bomber's Countdown must be
 a particularly strong technique.
 How'd it go?
 Has he disarmed the bombs yet?
 Book.
 81 restricted slot card types.
 They're all here, all right.
 We did as you requested...
 Disarm the bombs!
 But of course.
 I'm a man of my word.
 But first, hand over three Leave cards.
 Okay, we have a deal.
 Sub... Bara...
 Let's do this.
 Release.
 I released you
 from your terror.
 Th-That wasn't the deal...
 Why should I keep a promise
 I made to a bunch of scum?
 Release was the signal to explode, not disarm.
 Leave on!
 At least now, I don't have
 to worry about exploding.
 But until Genthru reverses his ability or dies,
 this thing won't disappear.
 I have a troublesome partner now...
 Hey, stop moving!
 The Bomber thinks he killed us all.
 I'll let him believe that...
 Until I make my move!
 Bisky...
 I think we should drop by
 their base real fast.
 They already ran out of time.
 Besides, he didn't even
 tell us exactly where it is.
 And even if we did know,
 we don't have a spell card
 that could take us there.
 I know.
 But some of them might have
 survived the explosion...
 Doubt it.
 If the Bomber's strong enough to place bombs
 on all his targets without anyone noticing,
 he wouldn't have made that kind of mistake.
 However...
 If we continue to play this game,
 we'll probably run into the Bomber.
 Given that, we may need
 to visit their base soon.
 Uh-huh.
 We need spell cards.
 Let's go to Masadora and
 sell our monster cards
 to buy spell cards.
 Yeah!
 Hey, Bisky...
 How long do you think it'll take me
 to master my special technique?
 You're just starting to develop your Nen.
 It's hard to predict when your
 power and speed will peak.
 Oh...
 But it shouldn't take too long
 before you get the form down.
 Really? How long?
 Let's see...
 Hopefully, you'll have it ready
 by the time Killua returns.
 All right!
 I'll finish my technique and surprise him!
 You two are lucky!
 We just received a huge
 shipment of spell cards.
 These are the spell cards they'd gathered.
 We bought sixty between us,
 so there are lots of different types.
 Look.
 Prison
 All slotted cards on target
 page are immune to theft
 or destruction via spell
 card until removed.
 (Only targets pages 1 - 11.
 Free slot pages
 cannot be targeted.)
 [DEF][CONT]
 An S-rank card...
 There are only ten in the whole game!
 What do you think?
 Should we save it?
 Or use it now?
 I don't know what to do!
 Shh!
 You're too loud...
 People will get suspicious!
 If only Killua were here...
 I can smell Gon on you.
 I'd like to see him again...
 We'll take you to the exam site.
 I need to zip on over and
 breeze through the exam,
 so I can hurry back to Gon.
 But the exam won't begin for a few days.
 Oh, right.
 In the meantime, you can tell
 us about yourself and Gon.
 Okay.
 I'll start with the story about
 when he came to visit my home.
 You're making steady progress.
 You're on track to have your
 special technique ready.
 This is a safe place to practice.
 Since we'll be able to spot anyone
 before they're in attack spell range.
 I can sense people watching from Masadora,
 just like I sensed people
 watching us at the start point.
 But we have plenty of defense spells now.
 Well, just to be safe,
 I used a Blackout Curtain card.
 Blackout Curtain
 Block one instance of enemy Steal or Fluoroscopy.
 (Does not stack when used on target already under
 effect of Blackout Curtain.)
 [DEF][CONT]
 But no point in worrying about spell cards.
 Just focus on training hard.
 Osu!
 Okay, one minute's up.
 Next.
 It didn't work.
 I can't reach it...
 That was just fine.
 You're in far better shape than
 a Transmuter would be!
 Be patient, and start by focusing
 on maintaining your aura
 in a sphere for extended periods of time.
 Osu!
 The longer you can maintain the
 sphere, the stronger your Ten.
 Once you've trained long enough,
 you'll be able to maintain an aura
 sphere for two to three days!
 You should be able to reach that
 stone before the day's out.
 You're right! I reached it!
 That was fast!
 This proves he's been hard at work
 on his Ten and Ren every day.
 Then, we'll go back to practicing the basics.
 Osu!
 Gon continues to train with Bisky,
 to master his special technique.
 Killua has temporarily left the game
 to retake the Hunter Exam.
 The two boys are working
 hard toward their goals.
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Blackout Curtain.
 Blackout Curtain
 Block one instance of enemy Steal
 or Fluoroscopy. (Does not stack
 when used on target already
 under effect of Blackout Curtain.)
 [DEF][CONT]
 With this card,
 other players can't see inside your binder.
 You can see inside my binder
 whenever you want, Killua.
 What?!
 Continue!
 Next time: Strategy x And x Scheme.

 Hey, hey, hey, hey, Killua-kun!

 follow their directions.
 It's been fun.
 Good luck.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Is this Mikhail's residence?
 Go do some shopping at
 Dick Sakura, by the station.
 At check out, give the cashier this card.
 Please come this way, sir.
 Strategy x And x Scheme
 There are more people this time.
 I wonder if there's anyone I know.
 Yo.
 Last year, you had your way with us.
 But that won't happen again.
 We've undergone some hellish training.
 Our teamwork is perfect now.
 Thank you for coming!
 This year, 1,489 applicants
 have made it this far,
 but the Phase Two examiner has asked me
 to trim that number to about 300.
 As for the exam...
 There are two hours before lunch.
 Defeat five people before then.
 Grab their tags when you defeat them,
 and see me when you have all five.
 I'll wait on the other side of the door.
 Got it?
 As soon as I shut the door,
 you may start.
 Every stage of the exam should be like this...
 You've gotta be strong to be a Hunter.
 Oh, you're here!
 Killuâ€”
 Sucks for you.
 I'm the only one passing this year.
 He's totally out of our league...
 So that's what it takes to
 become a top Hunter...
 This will be the last time I
 attempt the Hunter Exam...
 We finally have our first applicant.
 That took an hour and a half.
 What happened to everyone else?
 They're all asleep.
 It took me a while to collect all their tags.
 Is there going to be a second stage?
 That won't be necessary.
 He's demonstrated his skill.
 Killua, denizen of the darkness...
 He's returned much stronger.
 Applicant 1219, Killua-kun.
 Yeah.
 You've passed
 the Hunter Exam!
 Welcome back, Killua.
 How was the exam?
 I passed it in no time, naturally.
 Yay!
 Sorry to interrupt your celebration,
 but look at these spell cards.
 Wow...
 There's even an S-rank card!
 How much can we sell it for?
 Oh, let's go ask around!
 No, we should use it wisely.
 So what should we do?
 Well, I guess it's safe to hold on to it.
 With all these defensive spells,
 we don't need to worry
 about it getting stolen.
 Have you tried any of these?
 Just Blackout Curtain.
 What?
 If you have all these cards,
 you should use them...
 Start by using this one.
 You can choose a player you've
 met before, and talk to them.
 Contact
 Communicate with one target
 player (encountered within the
 game) via your Book.
 (Connection maintained for
 a maximum of 3 minutes.
 May only be broken by
 player who used this card.)
 [LR][NORM]
 Who should we talk to?
 We won't know until we see who's available.
 Contact on!
 Oh, I see a lot of names.
 Hey, Gon...
 When did you run into him?
 Huh?
 Chrollo Lucilfer
 Chrollo?
 Who's Chrollo?
 I haven't seen Chrollo inside the game.
 Does that mean you guys passed
 each other without noticing?
 Huh? What are you talking about?
 That doesn't make sense.
 Kurapika sealed his Nen.
 Yeah, and you have to use
 Nen to enter the game.
 Who's Kurapika?!
 That only leaves...
 Let me in on this!
 I get it. So that's what's going on.
 Hey, Shal...
 Stop laughing, and explain
 what this is about.
 Sorry about that.
 Chrollo Lucilfer
 This probably isn't the boss.
 He hasn't purged the Nen from his body.
 Purging Nen?
 It's very doable.
 Seriously?
 Of course!
 If you can place Nen on others,
 it's not unreasonable to think
 Nen can be removed, as well.
 Does that mean Chrollo has removed
 Kurapika's Nen, and entered the game?
 Why would he be here?
 I'm not sure,
 but we should probably let Kurapika know.
 I'll leave the game real quick.
 You can use a spell card to leave.
 Save it.
 I can be out and back in four hours.
 I should have realized this sooner...
 Yorknew City                                        Greed Island
 This island is directly east of Yorknew City.
 East is the direction to go.
 You will find one who awaits you.
 I see.
 So the boss came here to find
 someone to purge that Nen.
 The boss arrived the same way we did,
 but then Razor kicked him out.
 That was when he realized
 this was Greed Island.
 But since the boss can't use Nen,
 he can't enter the island
 via the usual channels.
 So he must have hired someone
 to come to this island for him.
 He had them use his name
 as a hidden message to us.
 The one who can purge this
 Nen is on Greed Island.
 Change in plans again...
 Let's bring everyone else here.
 Yes, we'll all start looking
 for this Nen exorcist.
 I have a small correction.
 You're...
 Hisoka!
 It was my idea to use Chrollo's name.
 Because I didn't know you could
 enter any name you like
 until I was already inside...
 You should praise my initiative.
 Since I helped you understand Chrollo's message.
 Ah, so that's what this is about.
 I'm dying to kill you right here and now,
 but I'll let the boss do that.
 Well, if anything comes up,
 use Contact to get in touch.
 If I learn anything new, I'll let you know.
 Bye.
 So the boss hired Hisoka...
 He probably didn't have much
 choice, but it's still weird.
 And his reward is probably a duel,
 once the boss is cleansed.
 But now, it's only a matter of time
 until the boss comes back!
 I doubt it.
 I would know at once
 if Nen I placed on a spider
 had been removed.
 So when you chose your power, you
 knew something like this might happen?
 Of course...
 If you're able to place Nen on others,
 it only makes sense to assume
 that one can also remove Nen.
 Well, now you know.
 What you do from here is up to you.
 Thanks for taking the trouble.
 You have my gratitude.
 Did you need anything?
 What am I...
 What am I supposed to do this month?
 Tell me...
 What should I do?
 It'll be fine. Let me handle...
 What could you possibly know?
 You have no idea what's going
 to happen to us now!
 Neon... I need Neon!
 Restore Neon at once!
 Damn! Why did this happen?
 I wonder what's wrong...
 Why did it stop working?
 See ya.
 Looks like it's not the real Chrollo.
 Oh...
 Kurapika was pretty calm about it.
 Like he wasn't concerned or just didn't care.
 Well, it sounds like you
 got worried for nothing.
 Now it's time to focus on yourselves.
 Osu!
 Start with the basics...
 We're not going to train.
 It's time to start
 beating this game!
 It's said the legendary King Great White Beetle
 lives only on this tree!
 There's only one way to capture it!
 Hit the tree hard enough to shake it out.
 First comes rock!
 Rock, paper...
 Rock!
 Wow!
 It's raining bugs!
 Found it.
 Difficulty rank A!
 King Great White Beetle
 A legendary insect that
 releases pheromones
 which attract other insects
 to start a massive colony.
 Can only leave the colony
 for brief evening walks.
 That's three King Great White Beetle cards!
 You could've gotten more if
 you'd thrown a real punch.
 Well, I didn't want to damage the tree.
 There is no such girl in this mansion.
 Even if there were, it would be impossible
 for you to bypass all the traps and find her.
 Found her.
 She was in a hidden room,
 four floors underground.
 What?
 Curse you!
 Got an A-rank Gold Dust Girl!
 Gold Dust Girl
 A girl who releases golden dust.
 One bath a day will net approx. 500 G.
 Very shy and quiet.
 The guard was a rank F.
 Next, let's head to the
 City of Gambling, Dorias!
 Wait, wasn't today supposed to be
 the monthly contest in Antokiba?
 We'll be passing through, so let's give it a go.
 Our winner is the Killua and Gon team.
 A Paladin's Necklace! Score!
 Paladin's Necklace
 When a player wears this,
 all spells targeting player
 will be reflected.
 Can also dispel curses
 placed on any card
 touched by player.
 I don't understand this description.
 We can ask one of the shopkeepers.
 When you wear this necklace,
 you can reflect all attack spells.
 And if you touch cards under the
 Transform
 Change one card in your possession into any
 other card in your possession. (Card will now
 count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
 and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
 [SR][NORM]
 Fake
 Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
 The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
 But it will not count toward Book completion,
 and cannot be transformed into an item.
 It also will not count toward card limit.
 [SR][NORM]
 effects of Transform or Fake,
 you can restore them to their original state.
 Wow...
 If we wear this, we won't have to
 worry about losing any cards.
 Memory Helmet...

 A player will always remember
 everything seen or heard
 while wearing this item.
 Unfortunately, helmet is
 very large and heavy.
 Witch's Love Potion.

 contains 500 pills.
 Risky Dice.
 Risky Dice
 A 20-sided die. One side says
 Bad Luck, while the other nineteen
 say Good Luck. If player rolls
 Good Luck, something good will
 happen. But if player rolls Bad Luck,
 something bad will happen to cancel
 out everything that was good.

 Paladin's Necklace.
 A total of six different restricted slot cards!
 Piece of cake!
 Piece of cake?
 Not in the least.
 This was only possible because you
 underwent that grueling training.
 Another player has used Contact to reach you.
 Yo. It's been a while, Gon.
 Who are you?
 You don't remember me?
 Do you remember the player
 who took the Sword of Truth
 from you in Antokiba?
 What do you want?
 Up for a trade?
 I have #66, Witch's Diet Pill,
 and #17, VIP Multi-Pass.
 You can talk it over with your friends.
 What do you think?
 Another player has used Contact to reach you.
 It's Tsezgerra.
 You again?
 Interested in trading your
 Breath of Archangel for our Patch of Forest?
 It's an SS-rank card.
 No way.
 I've already said I won't
 deal with you people.
 What if I throw in a Clone?
 I'm telling you that there's no deal here.
 You already have ninety-two different cards.
 All that's left
 are the cards monopolized
 by other players, yes?
 Actually, we have ninety-five...
 And you probably have many items
 that you haven't used Gain on yet.
 It's possible that Breath of Archangel
 is the final card you need.
 If we give that to you, we'll lose.
 Stop playing dumb.
 I know that you're monopolizing
 both Breath of Archangel and Night Jade.
 This game isn't over yet.
 I see.
 Good luck, then.
 But we'll never let you have these cards.
 What if I offer three cards?
 We'll give you Patch of Forest,
 Patch of Forest
 The entrance to an enormous
 forest known as the Mountain
 God's Garden. Many species
 exist only in this forest.
 All are friendly to humans.
 Hidden Hollow
 Upon entering and exiting hollow,
 player will be transported to a
 desolate location. However, player can
 return to original location
 without spending any money.
 Hidden Hollow,
 Palmtop Dragon
 As the name implies, this dragon
 fits on your palm. Willingly obeys
 its master. If raised lovingly,
 it can learn to speak.
 and Palmtop Dragon.
 And you only have to give us Night Jade,
 not Breath of Archangel.
 We'd be giving you one SS-rank
 card and two S-rank cards,
 while you'd only give up one A-rank card.
 I believe this deal is too good to pass up.
 Give us some time to discuss this.
 Just to be clear, this is our final offer.
 We won't accept any further negotiation.
 Book.
 It's gotta be a trap.
 That offer's too good.
 Tsezgerra is a careful man.
 He wouldn't try to pick a fight.
 But at the same time, he would
 never make a losing deal.
 Breath of Archangel
 An angel who can cure any mortal
 injury or terminal disease with one breath.
 However, angel will appear only once.
 Meaning that he thinks
 he can obtain a Breath of Archangel.
 Does that mean they've assembled
 all forty spell card types?
 It's possible.
 So they're waiting for Gain to be
 used on a Breath of Archangel.
 Night Jade
 A jewel blessed by the devil.
 When the holder is in danger,
 peril will be shifted to another.
 On the other hand, Night Jade is a card
 that we monopolized through hard work.
 If one of the cards were to be destroyed,
 one of our jade jewels would
 automatically turn into a card.
 Which means the A-rank
 Night Jade is much harder
 for them to get than the
 SS-rank Breath of Archangel.
 This is a gamble.
 Witch's Love Potion
 If player kisses a pill before
 feeding it to a target, target will
 become beholden to player.
 Each pill will remain effective
 for one week. Each bottle
 contains 500 pills.
 VIP Multi-Pass
 Present this pass to gain
 entry into any location.
 Contains 1000 passes.
 Book.
 See ya.
 That was uneventful.
 Kind of disappointing.
 I was so nervous...
 But now we've gathered
 seven types, in three days!
 We're making decent progress.
 Okay, let's keep this up.
 Are there any other events in the city
 for getting restricted slot cards?
 Hmm... I think there are...
 Prizes from the slot machines?
 Should've expected as much from
 Dorias, the City of Gambling.
 You have a 0.01% chance of winning.
 That's one in ten thousand tries.
 So it all comes down to luck.
 Pretty risky.
 I know, Gon!
 Use that dice!
 This is it...
 If we get Good Luck, we can win!
 But if you get Bad Luck,
 something bad will happen that cancels out
 everything good that's happened.
 There's only a one in twenty
 chance of getting Bad Luck.
 There!
 Next, we try the slot machine!
 Awesome! One try!
 Rainbow Diamond
 A diamond that glitters like
 a rainbow. If this diamond
 is presented when proposing,
 you will never be turned down.
 A Rainbow Diamond! Score!
 That's what I thought...
 This die is the key to winning in this city.
 But if you roll Bad Luck, it could be scary.
 Don't worry.
 It can't kill me...
 Oh, no! A slot machine exploded!
 I knew something was wrong.
 That guy hit the jackpot five times in a row.
 And he was acting weird...
 He kept rolling a funny-looking die.
 Yikes, his face is mush...
 Anyway, let's make the trade.
 Yeah, we want to get cards of rank S
 and above as quickly as possible.
 Yeah.
 As for cards rank A and below...
 Roll.
 S-Spare me...
 This is only your third time.
 You'll be fine.
 I-I know someone who got
 Bad Luck on the first roll and died!
 If I roll Bad Luck,
 I'll be hit for every Good Luck
 that the other players rolled!
 Not my problem.
 Roll.
 Or would you rather die right now?
 Come on...
 See?
 It's pretty rare to get Bad Luck.
 Now we use the Lottery card.
 We want #75, Lucky Alexandrite.
 If you obtain one, we'll set you free.
 C-Come on...
 Lottery on!
 Well?
 #76!
 So close!
 Your luck sucks.
 Okay, one more time!
 Hey, hey, hey, hey!
 Time for Motarike-kun to
 show us what he's got!
 No good, huh?
 Hey, Gen.
 Should we make the first move?
 I already told you that combat
 should be our last resort.
 It's too early for that.
 No, we're trying to stay
 one step ahead of them.
 Though, once we commit,
 further negotiation will be impossible.
 What do you have in mind?
 Tax Collector's Gauntlet
 When equipped, player has
 the ability to cast Levy. But
 each cast will destroy a random
 card from player's restricted
 slots. (Cannot use Levy if
 restricted slots are empty.)
 We use Tax Collector's Gauntlet,
 combined with Risky Dice.
 I understand.
 We use this to steal eight cards
 from them immediately...
 But it's definitely dangerous.
 If someone rolls Bad Luck, they'll probably die.
 But this job is too important to leave to them.
 We can do this!
 We've come this far.
 Let's clear the game.
 Hey, Gen...
 What are you up to?
 I've told you this many times.
 When taking a risk, we three share the danger.
 It's Tsezgerra.
 Have you reached a decision?
 Okay, you have a deal.
 I can do this...
 One more time!
 I said I can do this,
 so I'm gonna do it!
 Okay, let's move on to the next city!
 Gon's team has begun
 working to beat the game.
 The story is nearing its climax.
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Lottery.
 Lottery
 Change this card
 into a random item card.
 [SR][NORM]
 When you use this card,
 it changes into a random card.
 That's why it's effective to use with Risky Dice.
 Continue!
 Next time: 15 X 15.
 Hey, Killua, is this fifteen?
 What did you think it was?
 One five.
 Cute, huh...

67,"Staff of Judgment
 If player names a target,
 while raising staff toward the sky,
 disaster will befall either player or target,
 depending on which has done more evil.
 Elder's Growth Pills
 Each pill taken helps player grow 1 centimeter.
 Each bottle contains 100 pills.
 Not recommended for those under 20.
 Fledgling CEO
 If you warm this fledgling egg
 in your hands 3 hours a day,
 it will hatch in 1 to 10 years.
 The feelings you put into warming
 it will speed the process.
 Yes! Halfway there!
 That makes fifty types!
 15 x 15
 Genthru and his men have a plan in mind,
 as they prepare to trade
 with Team Tsezgerra.
 Let's get this over with, then.
 Okay, trade complete.
 No, hold on.
 I cannot accept this.
 This is an unfair trade.
 What? Don't complain once it's done!
 We gave you three cards!
 What more do you want?
 Wait a second...
 That isn't what I meant.
 I'm saying that it's unfair to you.
 It's too skewed in our favor.
 I dislike the idea of
 benefiting from charity.
 And it will continue to bother me,
 even if we clear the game first.
 So I have a proposition.
 Right or left.
 I'll give you one of these cards.
 One is worthless,
 but the other is Breath of Archangel.
 Good Luck
 Okay!
 Levy on!
 Crap!
 Return on.
 To Masadora!
 Let's go after them!
 Wait!
 First, check your cards!
 I lost one of the #80 cards
 we were monopolizing.
 As well as a #65.
 Hey, what did you lose?
 I lost #42 and #53.
 I lost #29 and #24.
 They got me good!
 I lost two of the #85
 cards we were hoarding.
 All the ones they took were
 restricted slot cards...
 And they took both card types
 that we were monopolizing.
 Damn!
 They must have used Risky Dice.
 We're not with them!
 They used items to change our faces!
 Anyway, we have to pursue them!
 No!
 Hey, is Genthru the Bomber?
 U-Uh, we don't know.
 But he went like this with his hand and
 blew the head off the guy I was with.
 A power clearly meant for murder.
 So he's a fighter.
 It would be unwise to
 fight them head-on.
 But they took at least five
 different card types from us!
 They could have completed
 their collection!
 List on!
 #2!
 Currently, 0 players own #2, Patch of Shore.
 Currently, 0 cards in play.
 We're still okay.
 They haven't found #2,
 Patch of Shore, yet.
 Our immediate priority
 is to find #2 before they do!
 We still have our voucher
 for Breath of Archangel,
 so we can still beat them.
 Right, let's find it first, then.
 Accompany
 Warp all players within 20 meters
 of caster to city (must have been visited)
 or player of your choice (must have
 been met inside the game).
 [SR][NORM]
 Accompany on!
 To Soufrabi!
 We did it... A big success.
 The Risky Dice and Levy
 combination paid off.
 That puts us at ninety-three types.
 No, we used one up to
 change those faces,
 so it's ninety-two.
 The important thing is that we took
 the cards they were monopolizing.
 And for two of the others, we're just
 waiting for someone to use Gain on them.
 The biggest obstacle is #2.
 But we know that it's in Soufrabi.
 All right, we'll go after #72,
 #21, and #9 in that order.
 Then we'll make for
 Soufrabi, to find #2.
 For #75, we simply need to find
 someone with it, then take it.
 I think it's time we began thinking...
 About the three restricted
 slot cards we want to keep,
 and how we want to spend the 50 billion.
 Hey, Killua...
 Something's been bugging me.
 Huh?
 Aren't there hundreds of players?
 Isn't it weird that we've been able
 to turn all our items into cards?
 What do you mean?
 Even B-rank restricted slot types
 have a thirty-card limit.
 The players here before us should
 have already collected them.
 That's true.
 But you can also see it this way.
 Fewer than thirty teams in this game
 are capable of making real progress.
 Oh, I see.
 Most players aren't worried
 about getting restricted slot cards.
 They're just struggling to find
 a way out of the game.
 It would suck if you got to Masadora,
 and there weren't any Leave cards.
 Yeah, that's why...
 I get it...
 Huh?
 If you guys got to Masadora,
 but there weren't any Leave cards,
 what would you do?
 Well...
 I'd save money until a Leave showed up.
 Yeah.
 Okay, then what if
 you acquired a super rare
 spell card while waiting?
 Sell it and buy more spell
 cards until a Leave came in.
 Really?!
 I would save it...
 Wouldn't it suck if all the cards you
 bought ended up being worthless?
 If you saved it, you might be
 able to trade for a Leaveâ€”
 See?
 Need a Leave?
 Want to go back to the real world?
 We've gotten four restricted
 slot cards for three Leaves.
 Okay, that makes a total
 of fifty-four types.
 Score!
 So the cards that wouldn't fit in
 our binders reverted to items.
 We're running out of free pockets.
 Then we should organize them now.
 We three have a total
 of 135 free pockets.
 We should each leave
 around 5 pockets free.
 You keep the spell cards, Killua.
 Bisky should also have
 a few defensive ones.
 Wait! I have to use spell cards?
 No way! I don't know how they work.
 The hell? Then learn how they work!
 Okay...
 Book.
 We've been deliberately
 avoiding other players,
 but we'll have to take risks
 to obtain the rarer cards.
 Yeah.
 Well, let's get what we can ourselves,
 then negotiate aggressively
 with any players we come across.
 Sound good?
 Yeah.
 Yep!
 See ya.
 Hold on.
 This is worthless.
 It's a transformed Fake.
 Sorry about that.
 I gave you the wrong one.
 Here's the real one.
 Man, you can't lower your guard
 around any of these guys.
 No kidding...
 Still, that necklace is quite useful.
 Hey, this necklace can
 remove curses, right?
 Only from spell cards.
 Oh, so it won't work.
 Did you have an idea?
 I was wondering if a curse
 was behind the disease
 that all those villagers
 were suffering from.
 Villagers?
 Oh, those people...
 The ones who took all your money.
 But it won't work since
 they aren't cards.
 No.
 It's worth a shot.
 Will you trust us with your lives?
 You freely gave us everything you had.
 We will trust you!
 Sick Villagers
 Villagers struck by a
 contagion passing
 around the island.
 Healthy Villagers
 Healthy villagers who
 recovered from the contagion
 going around the island.
 It worked!
 Thank you very much!
 This treasure has been
 passed down for generations.
 Please accept this
 token of our gratitude.
 Awesome!
 Lucky Alexandrite
 Owner will enjoy
 once-in-a-lifetime experiences,
 for better or for worse.
 Lucky Alexandrite! Score!
 Another player has used
 Contact to reach you.
 Yo, this is Kazsule.
 I'd like to talk to you.
 Could we meet in person?
 About what?
 Some people are close
 to clearing the game.
 Huh?
 It's a team of three,
 led by someone named Genthru.
 Genthru!
 Thanks for coming, everyone.
 Much appreciated.
 Team Kazsule
 As I mentioned via Contact,
 Team Asta
 Team Genthru is close
 to completing the game.
 Team Hanse
 I just checked the ranking,
 Goreinu
 and they're currently
 at ninety-six types.
 Team Yabibi
 We must figure out a way to stop them.
 Can I ask something?
 What is it?
 How do you check the ranking?
 Well...
 You don't know how to do that?
 If we answer all their questions,
 we'll be here till dawn!
 Just cut to the chase.
 Now, don't be so mean...
 We're all here to exchange information.
 They could have information
 you don't, Asta.
 That's impossible.
 Those kids are amateurs who don't even
 know how to use the Trade Shop.
 In the Trade Shop,
 there's a ranking that lists
 players and their total
 restricted slot cards.
 If you pay a fee, you can even learn
 the numbers of their cards.
 But getting a player's name from
 the ranking still won't let you
 use Contact or Fluoroscopy on them.
 Not until you actually meet them.
 Don't you feel smarter now, boys?
 In other words, if we know
 the members of a team,
 we can determine how
 many cards they have.
 And Team Genthru is only missing #0,
 #2, #9, and #75.
 #75...
 There's a solid theory that #0 appears
 in an event after the other
 ninety-nine are collected,
 so they only need three.
 We propose to find one of those
 three types before they do
 and monopolize it, to prevent
 them from clearing the game.
 There's gotta be something else.
 We could deluge them with spell cards.
 They already have a Paladin's Necklace.
 So Levy is the only
 spell that will work.
 Levy
 Take 1 card at random from every
 player within 20 meters of caster.
 [SR][SP]
 And they can block Levy if
 certain conditions are met.
 It's safe to assume
 that Genthru is willing to reveal
 that they have ninety-six types
 Prison
 All slotted cards on target page are
 immune to theft or destruction via spell card
 until removed.
 (Only targets
 pages 1 - 11.
 Free slot pages
 cannot be targeted.)
 [DEF][CONT]
 because their pages are
 protected by Prison.
 That's possible...
 Genthru was collecting
 a bunch of spell cards
 with the others who tried to recruit us.
 It's a reasonable assumption.
 We could always take
 their cards by force.
 Would you be willing to lead the attack?
 We don't know what kind
 of abilities they have.
 Finding a card type to monopolize
 is the most practical option.
 I assume no one has objections.
 Then let's get to business.
 We'll need everyone here to cooperate.
 I'm fine with the proposed plan.
 But I have a problem with these members.
 Hold on, Asta.
 I followed your condition...
 Have over fifty types of cards.
 These six teams met that condition.
 I also said that they had to be
 people who could contribute.
 I don't see how these kids
 can contribute anything.
 You're the one being uncooperative.
 You've got a smart mouth.
 Then show me some proof
 that you can be useful.
 We know Team Genthru's abilities.
 We have one of the three
 cards they're missing.
 Still dissatisfied?
 No, that's good enough.
 So tell us what their abilities are.
 What about you?
 Show us some proof you
 can be useful to us.
 We have seventy-one types
 of restricted slot cards...
 Significantly more than you.
 I'll give you an A-rank card in
 return for the information.
 You shouldn't have a problem with that.
 I have a problem.
 We can obtain A-rank cards ourselves.
 So give us two S-rank cards or
 equally valuable information.
 Otherwise, we won't tell you a thing.
 Don't get too cocky, brat!
 Did you hear that, everyone?
 These kids won't be any help.
 They want two S-rank
 cards from each team.
 That's ten cards they'd take.
 Don't be a fool.
 I'm only taking cards from your team.
 Huh?
 I'm fine with giving information
 to the other four.
 I'll let them decide
 what to offer in return.
 But I won't tell you anything
 until you meet my condition.
 You are a stupid brat...
 Throwing a tantrum because
 I didn't baby you, huh?
 Stop this, both of you...
 We don't have time to
 fight amongst ourselves!
 I haven't agreed to
 team up with them yet!
 It's fine, Asta...
 Give them two cards.
 We need to move on.
 What?!
 I have no problem with
 giving them cards!
 But that kid's trying to pick a fight!
 You're the one picking a fight!
 Hey, let's leave.
 I don't want to team
 up with these people!
 Come, now...
 Though I admit I'm a bit peeved.
 But given the circumstances...
 Genthru has these two abilities,
 Countdown and Little Flower.
 So it's best to keep
 your distance from him.
 Seriously? He got me...
 Same here.
 He touched me when we
 were making a deal.
 Me, too...
 Sounds like a bunch of
 them might be victims.
 A chance!
 Isn't there any way to
 disable his technique?
 Yep, there is...
 You have to touch Genthru and say,
 ""I caught the Bomber.""
 Stupid! Why did you tell them?
 We could've gotten more
 cards out of them!
 That would have started another fight.
 The bombs can't be armed until Genthru
 explains how his ability works,
 so if you keep away from him,
 you should be safe.
 Did you know there are
 two ways to cast spells?
 Yep, I did.
 A spell card is used up the
 moment you say its name aloud.
 But it's possible to
 keep reusing a spell.
 Huh?
 For example, you know how a list
 of players you've met appears if
 you put Steal in your binder?
 If you remove the card without
 pressing the select button,
 the spell card isn't used up,
 so you can keep reusing it.
 I never tried that.
 Yeah.
 You can buy all B-rank
 restricted slot cards at stores.
 You simply need to buy from the
 same Trade Shop over fifty times.
 If you become a frequent customer,
 they'll start making you offers.
 Do you have two Skeleton Glasses cards?
 Or Emerald for Beauty and Mystery Pond?
 Is that enough information
 to satisfy you?
 I'll give you another
 card if you're not happy.
 Nope, that's enough, thanks!
 I'm up next, then.
 I'm Goreinu.
 Nice to meet you.
 Thanks, everyone!
 That was very educational.
 The question now is which card
 we should try to monopolize.
 It's probably impossible to
 monopolize the #75 we have.
 Each team can only obtain one,
 and the limit is twenty,
 which is too high.
 You obtained #75?
 That's impressive.
 List on!
 #75.
 Currently, 6 players own #75, Lucky Alexandrite.
 Currently, 6 cards are in play.
 So five other teams each have one.
 Monopolizing this one
 will be impossible.
 What about the other two?
 List on!
 #9!
 List on.
 #2.
 No good.
 There are three teams with #9.
 No one has #2, Patch of Shore...
 We can make it work!
 Guide Post On.
 #2.
 I know where to find it...
 Soufrabi.
 I've been there before!
 I have an Accompany card here.
 Okay, let's go.
 Accompany on!
 To Soufrabi!
 This is Soufrabi?
 It's a pretty big city...
 Soufrabi
 Let's head in and snoop around.
 Search every room, one by one.
 Some characters may not
 give you information
 until you visit multiple
 times, so pay attention.
 Okay!
 Hey!
 I found someone with information.
 Fast!
 The pirates rule this city...
 There's a legend about
 an underwater cavern
 called the Sea God's Grotto
 located somewhere in this area.
 Patch of Shore is the entrance to it.
 A few years ago, having heard of the
 legendary cavern and its treasure,
 fifteen pirates arrived in this city.
 Razor and the fourteen devils...
 The city fishermen were
 all tortured and killed.
 The pirates murdered anyone who
 knew about Patch of Shore.
 If you get rid of the pirates,
 I'll tell you what I know.
 When we visited a few months earlier,
 we couldn't find a single clue.
 This must be information only
 available at certain times.
 Maybe an event that only
 occurs at this time frame?
 Razor and the fourteen devils...
 It's possible that the event
 was triggered by the
 number of players here.
 Huh?
 There are fifteen pirates.
 And it just so happens that
 there are fifteen of us.
 So the event won't start until you
 have a party of fifteen or more?
 But how would a game
 character know that?
 Oh, Accompany!
 Yes, a group of fifteen or more must
 reach Soufrabi with Accompany.
 That's probably the
 trigger for this event.
 Brutal...
 Huh?
 Oh, nothing.
 Let's go to the pirate's base!
 Gon and his friends stand before
 some unpleasant looking pirates.
 Will the fifteen allies be able
 to obtain Patch of Shore?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card
 Tax Collector's Gauntlet.
 Tax Collector's Gauntlet
 When equipped, player has
 the ability to cast Levy. But
 each cast will destroy a random
 card from player's restricted
 slots. (Cannot use Levy if
 restricted slots are empty.)
 If you turn this card into
 an item and equip it,
 you can steal random cards from others.
 And you can keep reusing it!
 Clunk.
 Continue!
 Next time: Pirates x And x Guesses.
 Go!
 I can't say that!
",0.34919942563283257,0.43777731739101,0.2049558828280169
68,"Who are you guys?
 We booked this place for the night.
 Get lost!
 We're here to talk.
 Would you please leave the city?
 Been a long time since I heard those words.
 Pirates x And x Guesses
 Then no need for talk.
 Use force to make us leave.
 I don't care how many of you attack at once.
 If you can move me from this ring,
 I'll take you to see our boss.
 We just have to move you out of the ring?
 If it's brawn you want, I'm your man.
 This guy's terrible.
 He's taking too long just to
 produce that degree of Ren.
 You're pretty strong...
 Stop it!
 I lose... Let me go!
 He admitted defeat.
 Why didn't you let him go?
 I explained the rules.
 You lose if you step outside the ring.
 Anything else, including admitting
 defeat, is totally meaningless.
 You kicked me, then stepped
 outside the ring of fire.
 You've lost.
 Oh! Crap!
 Hold on! Give me another try!
 Don't bother, Gon...
 You're probably looking to
 use your new technique.
 But you shouldn't reveal it in
 front of all these people.
 Just let me handle this.
 What's this? You gonna pair up now?
 I'll be using this.
 You wouldn't...
 There, I win.
 D-Damn little brat!
 You made up the rules...
 Don't get upset.
 Yeah, my bad...
 Come with me.
 I'll take you to the boss.
 Eh, so your boss is in here?
 Boss, we have visitors.
 Who are these guys?
 They want to chase us out of town.
 Chase us out?
 Ah...
 Let's have a contest.
 If you win, we'll leave the island.
 However, we choose the contest.
 How does that sound?
 What happens if we lose?
 Nothing.
 You'll just have to leave.
 Okay, let's do this!
 The theme of this battle is sports.
 Each of these members will challenge
 you to a match in their best sport.
 One win per person!
 The first side to eight wins will be the victor.
 I'm up first... I'll go with boxing.
 Well? Who's up?
 I've got this.
 There's one special rule.
 You may use any item created by Nen.
 What?
 You can't call that boxing!
 Don't worry, I'll only use my fists.
 That rule's for your benefit.
 Wanna tag out?
 No, I'll do it.
 Fight!
 I know what's going on here...
 There's a reason you chose boxing!
 You're also an Emitter, right?
 We're fighting at close range,
 within a finite space.
 This is the ideal situation for an Emitter.
 However, you made one mistake!
 Not anticipating that my power
 could be stronger than yours!
 Wow! He can't dodge that flurry!
 Yes, he's down! Too easy!
 No, it was a simultaneous hit.
 What just happened?
 Why?
 These guys didn't see what happened?
 He used teleportation.
 Teleportation?
 Of only his fist, with a short uppercut.
 His goal was to land a knockout counterstrike.
 It was obvious.
 Seems he's out cold...
 That's one win for us.
 Damn.
 Bah.
 Reaching eight wins with these
 members will be impossible.
 Meaning...
 Okay, I'm up next...
 I'll go with juggling soccer balls.
 Then I'm up...
 Wait, Gon.
 Indeed, that would be wise.
 Okay, I'm up next!
 A little girl?
 Now I'll have to take care not to injure you.
 Injure me with juggling?
 We're allowed to attack using Nen.
 Provided you don't touch
 the ball with your hands.
 I understand.
 Moving anywhere inside the building is allowed.
 Whoever drops their ball first loses.
 Right! Got it!
 Okay, let's get started.
 Ready...
 Go!
 What?
 That was harder than I expected...
 I lose.
 I'm up next, then.
 You wanna go, big guy?
 You bet! Prepare yourself, brat!
 Ready, begin!
 I'll crush you!
 Oh, sorry about that...
 I stepped outside the ring.
 Now I see... That's what they're doing.
 That's eight wins.
 We're the victors.
 Get out.
 And we can do as we please in this city.
 Damn it, you brat! Come back here!
 We need to fight again!
 When you saw we couldn't
 win with this lineup,
 you decided to lose deliberately,
 and gather information, huh?
 But once a party has lost,
 they can't make another attempt.
 But it's okay if we simply
 switch out one member.
 It was a worthwhile risk.
 You can count us out.
 Huh?
 We've accomplished our original objective,
 keeping the Bombers from completing the game.
 It will be impossible for them to
 assemble a team of fifteen.
 You should probably give up on this contest.
 If you end up obtaining the card,
 you'll just become a target.
 They don't get it...
 It makes sense to obtain this card quickly.
 To avoid potential internal conflict.
 Exactly.
 Huh?
 You need at least fifteen people to participate.
 Even if you use Clone,
 Clone
 Transform into a random card
 selected from the restricted slots
 of one target player. (If target has
 empty restricted slots or max of
 selected card has been reached,
 Clone is used up without transforming.
 [LR][NORM]
 you can only obtain three
 copies of Patch of Shore.
 This event was designed to incite infighting.
 That's what you meant.
 Brutal...
 I had to think about that, since I
 didn't understand right away.
 Assuming that we four are capable of winning,
 we still need four more up to the task.
 And ideally, they'd already
 be in a party of eleven.
 Do you have any leads?
 Book.
 Looking at the names on my list,
 Chrollo's probably the strongest.
 But Kurapika said he's definitely a fake.
 Who is it, then?
 Well, it's probably a member of the Troupe.
 Why would a member of the Troupe be here?
 Maybe to beat the game?
 But wouldn't they have used their own name?
 That's true.
 We can use Sight Vision.
 Huh?
 If this person isn't here to beat the game,
 they won't bother to collect cards.
 Oh, that's right.
 0 cards in restricted slots
 6 cards in free slots
 This guy's not even trying.
 His only cards are for food and water.
 That makes it easier to invite them.
 But if it really is a member of the
 Troupe, we won't invite them.
 We'll just ask a few questions.
 Then there's no point in bothering.
 Since it's definitely one of them.
 Finding out who they are is important,
 but I'd rather learn why they're here!
 Are you an idiot?!
 You're gonna ask them why they're here?
 They aren't gonna tell you!
 Yeah, I'm an idiot!
 I'm an idiot, so I'm still gonna ask!
 Then go right ahead!
 I sure will!
 Will they be okay?
 This is perfectly normal for them.
 I'm off, then!
 Knock yourself out.
 Accompany on!
 Chrollo Lucilfer.
 No way...
 Hisoka!
 Well, well...
 I have unexpected visitors.
 It's been a while.
 As I thought.
 You've matured quite a lot.
 It appears that you found
 an excellent teacher.
 As I anticipated, you grow more
 appetizing with every day.
 Wh-Who is this pervy freak?
 Are you their teacher?
 No, it doesn't seem to be him.
 Stop it!
 She's the one?
 So what do you want with me...
 No, with Chrollo?
 I have a question.
 Why are you here?
 Well, what to do?
 If I talk, I know how they'll react.
 They'll do all they can to keep the spiders from the Nen exorcist.
 That would certainly be entertaining.
 But I have delayed my fight
 with Chrollo long enough.
 I'm looking for Chrollo.
 There's actually a way
 to remove Kurapika's Nen from him.
 You can purge it.
 So you knew?
 Then that makes this easier.
 I'm looking for Chrollo,
 to give him that information,
 but I have no leads.
 That's when I remembered
 that some of the spiders were
 interested in this game.
 I thought that maybe they would
 know Chrollo's whereabouts.
 And by choosing this name, I ensure
 that they will come to me.
 I get it.
 He was just pretending to
 be a member of the Troupe.
 Uh-huh.
 Now, it is my turn for a question.
 You didn't come here just
 to ask that, did you?
 No, I did.
 Um...
 Actually, we're looking for
 people who are really strong.
 Won't you please join us?
 Hmm? Sure.
 Why are you looking for strong people?
 Wait, h-hold on... I'm against this.
 It's too dangerous!
 Yeah, you don't know who this guy is, Bisky!
 Oh? That's not true.
 I can sense that he's a kindred spirit.
 He's lying.
 We should head to the
 City of Love just ahead, Aiai.
 It's a great place for new meetings.
 Perhaps you can find strong people there.
 What did you mean about him lying?
 Technically, I should say he
 wasn't speaking the truth.
 How could you tell?
 I had a gut feeling.
 A gut feeling?!
 After lying for fifty years,
 I can recognize a fellow liar.
 That's a convincing argument.
 Since he's hiding something,
 we'll keep him around to see what's up.
 Plus, he really is strong, right?
 Uh-huh...
 Hey, Hisoka!
 You walk in front!
 We need ten more members, correct?
 Yeah...
 We hope to find others like you
 who aren't interested in cards.
 Isn't everyone else here to beat the game?
 I can't imagine there are too
 many eccentrics like myself.
 He's definitely hiding something.
 By the way,
 did you use someone's power to warp to me?
 That was one of the spells in this game.
 Oh, so that's what it was.
 You need to buy spells from stores, right?
 Something does seem fishy.
 He isn't being honest.
 In other words, there's something
 inconsistent in his story.
 He came here to find spiders who
 might know Chrollo's location.
 There's something off about that explanation.
 City of Love, Aiai
 Where are my glasses?
 Why not give them to her?
 You might become friends.
 Hey...
 Watch where you're going!
 Be more careful.
 S-Sorry...
 I'm gonna be late!
 You weren't supposed to apologize...
 You should have told her to watch where
 she was going and started a fight.
 Stop it!
 Release me! I'll scream...
 Go ahead and scream.
 No one's coming to save you.
 Hold it!
 Let go of her!
 That hurt...
 How could you fall for such a clichÃ©?!
 You want me to model for your hairstyling?
 Please allow me to cut your long, lovely hair.
 Of course.
 There's no point in hanging around this city.
 Hisoka, let's head somewhere else.
 Oh?
 But we won't be bored here.
 Bored...
 That's it!
 That's what was wrong.
 This place...
 This place is the problem!
 If I entered this game to find someone,
 what would I do?
 I would see how important
 the spell cards are.
 Gon and Bisky ran into Hisoka
 while I was outside, taking the Hunter Exam.
 That means they encountered him
 while they were training near Masadora.
 Hisoka's been to Masadora!
 Right, normally it makes no sense
 for him to leave Masadora.
 Because most players pass through
 the city, in search of spell cards.
 If he were truly looking for the Troupe,
 he wouldn't have left Masadora.
 But we won't be bored here.
 He's bored because he has nothing to do.
 So he isn't looking for anyone.
 No...
 He's already found them!
 That must be it!
 That's in line with what Bisky said.
 Hisoka already met up with the Troupe,
 and he's waiting for something.
 What is he waiting for?
 That's obvious...
 The Nen purger.
 The Nen purger is here, on Greed Island!
 Hisoka and the Troupe know this.
 I can't tell Gon yet...
 He can't keep a secret.
 If Hisoka realizes we know, he'll disappear.
 If he leaves, we'll be down a member.
 And we won't know what
 the Troupe is doing.
 We can't let that happen.
 Hey, Killua... I've been thinking.
 We should probably try to recruit Tsezgerra.
 Even if he doesn't join,
 we should meet with him,
 so he'll be on our binder list.
 It would be good to know what they're doing.
 Binder? I can find out!
 Hisoka, let me see your binder.
 I want to see if Tsezgerra
 is on the list of players you've met.
 List?
 That's perfect!
 If I asked questions, Hisoka would be suspicious.
 But Gon knows nothing,
 so Hisoka won't suspect a thing.
 Book.
 If Hisoka refuses to show us the screen,
 that'll support my theory.
 There's Tsezgerra.
 Really?
 Yes, right here.
 Huh?
 He showed us? No way!
 There aren't any Troupe members...
 Was I being paranoid?
 Is Hisoka actually still looking for them?
 Then, Hisoka, recite this spell...
 We'll do the talking.
 Contact on.
 Tsezgerra.
 My Texture Surprise
 really is so very useful.
 Shizuku
 Phinks
 Franklin
 Shalnark
 Hisoka's ability fools Killua and his friends.
 Is Hisoka a friend or foe?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Paladin's Necklace.
 Paladin's Necklace
 When a player wears this,
 all spells targeting player
 will be reflected.
 Can also dispel curses
 placed on any card
 touched by player.
 This card can reflect enemy spells,
 and tell you if other cards are real.
 Are you real?
 Huh?
 Continue!
 Next time: A x Heated x Showdown.
 I win!
 One more time!
 Gon, where are you going?
",0.22306261134023467,0.46708581149578093,0.1625626600968341
69,"Together, there are five of you?
 Yeah, this is all of us.
 There are two others in my group.
 This only gives us a total of nine.
 Where do you plan to find the rest?
 We'll need fifteen members, right?
 We can use stand-ins for the remaining six.
 Invite players who want to return
 to the real world but can't.
 They won't be able to help,
 but they won't care about
 receiving cards, either.
 Meaning that the nine of us will
 have to win the contest.
 I don't know how strong our
 opponents are, but can we?
 We can.
 Even if we can't manage eight wins,
 we're allowed to switch members and try again.
 So whether we can win depends on you guys.
 Show us your Ren.
 We'll decide if we want you afterwards.
 A x Heated x Showdown
 I see our roles have been reversed.
 Very well.
 Here I go!
 Awesome!
 If I use my full strength, I can fly higher.
 My record is sixteen meters,
 eighty centimeters.
 Ready, and...
 They shattered my record with ease.
 Ha ha, I win.
 How much have they improved
 in such a short period of time?
 Darn!
 I am impressed.
 Although you still fall a bit
 short of my full height.
 Okay! Let's go again!
 No way.
 You won't stop until you win.
 One more time... Just once more!
 Oh, you passed.
 Nice jump.
 Sorry...
 Once more!
 They're only kids, so let it slide.
 Fine.
 We believe that you guys are strong.
 But it comes down to figuring out
 who to assign to which sport.
 Killua, once more!
 See, I knew it...
 No more. I win!
 Do we know all the sports they'll use?
 We've managed to confirm these eight.
 Beach Volleyball
 Wrestling
 Boxing
 Juggling
 Free Throws
 Sumo
 Bowling
 Ping Pong
 Depending on our success,
 they may add additional sports.
 I understand...
 Hey, this is bad!
 What is it?
 Team Genthru is up to ninety-seven cards.
 Then they're only missing...
 Patch of Shore and Lucky Alexandrite!
 Over the past week, we've run various simulations
 and have prepared accordingly.
 Given Team Genthru's current situation,
 we can't afford to lose.
 We have to win!
 Yes, we'll win.
 This isn't too bad...
 Okay, let's go.
 We'll begin with boxing.
 I'll send you packing.
 His special ability is teleportation.
 He can teleport his uppercut.
 Fight!
 H-He's fast!
 An infighter?
 If I'm close enough, his Emitter
 advantages are worthless.
 He'll be so busy guarding,
 he won't have a chance to use teleportation!
 Nice!
 The pattern depicted on the ring
 is a sacred symbol that boosts Nen.
 Suggesting that he can only teleport
 while standing within the ring.
 Essentially, he's revealing that
 he isn't all that strong.
 An opponent unworthy of us.
 The winner is Barry!
 Yes!
 The winner is Rodriot!
 The winner is Kess!
 Yes!
 That's three wins!
 In terms of combat strength,
 those six are very strong.
 This is getting interesting...
 You guys can toss your matches.
 I'll take it from here.
 Roger that.
 Wait!
 I'm done following your orders.
 I'll be doing things my own way now.
 Hey, brat! Let's step outside!
 Outside? Do you think this is a sumo ring?
 I'm done playing around.
 Want me to kill you here?
 Hey, Bobobo!
 That's a violation of our agreement.
 Want to go back to the slammer, Bobobo?
 I don't give a damn!
 I'm done playing this stupid game!
 Anyone else with me?
 If we team up, we can crush that bastard.
 And then we can use a ship
 to get off this island!
 You'll be punished for breaking the taboo.
 Didn't I warn you?
 Y-Yes, you did...
 Did that idiot think I wouldn't kill him?
 Okay, I'll go next.
 Hey, this looks bad.
 We can't fight those guys...
 No, hold on.
 We'll be doing the fighting.
 We explained how this works.
 If the nine of us cannot secure eight victories,
 you can just forfeit without fighting.
 Really?
 You guarantee we won't have to fight?
 Yeah, don't worry.
 That guy has a much stronger aura than the rest.
 And judging by the previous conversation,
 he must be a Game Master.
 Can I ask something?
 That guy's dead.
 What about the sumo match?
 Hmm? Oh, you get the win.
 But we never decided who we were sending.
 You're the one who said you
 were going to do the sumo.
 I don't care who you give the win to.
 Just give it to one of the guys
 standing in the back.
 Okay, you get the sumo win.
 Eh? Wait, me?
 That gives us four wins.
 Now, then...
 I'll go with an eight-on-eight game
 of dodgeball.
 Pick the eight members you'll field.
 I already have mine.
 Hold on...
 How is this scored?
 It's one win per person, right?
 Yes, one win per person.
 So the victorious team receives eight wins.
 Simple enough, yes?
 So that was the plan?
 No matter how many of his weaker members
 we defeat, he can still win
 the entire game alone.
 Razor and the fourteen devils...
 The devils are his Nen ability!
 I'm against this...
 If we have to field eight, you need two more!
 I'm not fighting that guy!
 I'm leaving now...
 Once the match begins,
 you can deliberately let yourself be hitâ€”
 Screw that!
 Didn't you see that?
 If he hits us with that ball, we're dead!
 Oh, just so everything is clear,
 we'll be using a normal ball.
 But with Nen, it's just as strong as
 the Nen projectile I launched earlier.
 This is crazy... I'm outta here!
 Sorry, but I don't want to die yet...
 H-Hold on!
 We'll think of something real quick.
 This is very bad.
 We only have six players of any use.
 So we're forced to pick two
 of these spineless wimps.
 We'll do this by ourselves.
 If our lives are on the line,
 we should only field willing players.
 Do you have a problem if we only field six?
 Yes, actually, I can't let you do that...
 You will have to field eight members.
 Otherwise, why ask you to recruit fifteen?
 Saying this to an in-game character
 is probably pointless,
 but wasn't Bobobo one of your allies?
 What did he do to deserve death?
 Burglary-murder and rape-murder.
 Eleven confirmed counts alone.
 This is the real world.
 This place, Greed Island, is located
 somewhere in the real world.
 This game takes place in the real world.
 Revealing that information to a player who
 believes they're inside a game is a taboo.
 Bobobo was executed for breaking that taboo.
 This guy, Razor, is a Game Master,
 a real human.
 Game Master?
 One of the people who made this game.
 Huh?
 Wait, then...
 Bobobo and the other pirates
 are real death row criminals.
 Not only did he disobey orders;
 he attempted to instigate an escape.
 Execution was a fair consequence.
 This is the real world?
 That is correct.
 I never noticed.
 I hadn't even considered that.
 Well, it doesn't really matter.
 Since this island is still isolated
 from the rest of the world.
 Wait a second.
 If this is the real world,
 does that mean that Ging is here,
 on Greed Island?
 Ging?
 Ah...
 So you must be Gon.
 Yeah.
 I was instructed not to go easy on you
 by your old man.
 I've had enough...
 I don't wanna die!
 Count me out! I'm gone!
 H-Hey!
 It's okay, let them leave.
 But then we can't have a match!
 I'll count as three.
 You're doing the same thing,
 so it shouldn't be a problem.
 Yeah, that's fine.
 Now it's eight-on-eight.
 I'll explain the rules.
 The game starts with one outside
 player and seven inside.
 The first team to run out of inside players loses.
 Any player inside the court who's hit by
 a ball thrown by an opponent is out,
 and must move outside.
 However,
 you may bring one player inside
 the court again by saying ""Back.""
 And if the ball hits an area outside
 the court, without any players,
 the opposing team gets the ball.
 Now, the important stuff...
 The rules regarding hits
 employ a cushion effect.
 For example, if I throw the ball
 and it hits opposing player A, ricochets,
 and hits opposing player B
 before hitting the floor,
 both A and B are out.
 But if player B in that scenario
 is able to catch the ball,
 player A is safe.
 Exactly.
 But if I throw the ball and it
 hits opposing player A, ricochets,
 and hits my teammate, player C,
 before hitting the floor,
 only player C is out.
 Then if player C catches the ball,
 does that mean player A is out?
 Indeed.
 Uh...
 Do you have a question?
 If an outside player hits someone
 with the ball, is the hit player out?
 Naturally, they're out.
 But only one player
 can return to the court using Back.
 I am Number 0, the ref.
 Let's have a clean game.
 We will now begin the game.
 Ready...
 Go!
 You can make the first move.
 You sound quite confident.
 Here's a little greeting, then!
 You got him!
 Yes! That's one down!
 Good!
 Let's keep this up.
 There!
 Okay, that's two down!
 Oh, this is easy.
 Okay, all ready to go...
 Huh? What did you say?
 I'm prepared to defeat you now.
 Heh, that's funny.
 Show us what you've got!
 H-He stopped it with one hand?
 Right, then...
 Time to launch the counterattack.
 He's standing so far back...
 Is he going to pass it?
 Fast!
 Can I dodge it?
 No way!
 Can I catch it and live?
 No!
 I'll die!
 Death
 White Goreinu!
 Nice rebound.
 Goreinu's outside the court!
 I see...
 You have the ability to change
 places with your Nen beasts.
 The Nen creature was shattered...
 This reflects what Goreinu imagined would
 happen when he saw Razor's attack.
 He immediately grasped the gap between
 our opponent's strength and his own.
 He won't easily rid himself of that image.
 It'll be impossible for him to
 recover during this match.
 He's done.
 Goreinu's Nen beast is the one that's out, right?
 Yes, the exchange was performed
 with Nen, so it broke no rules.
 However, Back must be used to
 bring Goreinu inside the court.
 Damn... Is this how it ends?
 All right, let's move on!
 That pass is so fast!
 I-It's too fast...
 I can't follow the ball!
 Tsezgerra!
 Behind you!
 It's heavy...
 As heavy as a bowling ball.
 This is gonna have insane power.
 He focused his aura in his back,
 and avoided a lethal blow.
 Hey, patch him up.
 I-I'm fine... Don't touch me.
 If a player is unable to continue
 playing, they're disqualified.
 They won't be allowed
 to play in or outside the court,
 so keep that in mind.
 Are you okay?
 Yeah, I've really lost it...
 Damn, in overall combat ability,
 I should still be stronger than they are.
 But when it comes to the basics like
 agility and reflexes, they have me beat.
 It's been a while since I've
 had to work really hard.
 Maybe it's time to start training from scratch.
 I don't think I've done any basic
 training in the past few years.
 Ideally, we could knock out
 everyone on the other team
 without giving up the ball.
 Hisoka...
 Okay, give me the ball.
 Oh, that's right.
 If he uses his Bungee Gum, he can
 retrieve the ball after it hits!
 Now, do try to entertain me.
 Surely this isn't everything you have.
 Very well...
 Okay, that's three down!
 With Back, the other team still has five players!
 With Bungee Gum, we can stay on the offensive.
 All that's left is the order we target them.
 Question for the ref.
 Can the last player inside the court
 use Back at the second he's hit?
 That's not allowed.
 For a moment, there would
 be zero players in the court,
 so that team would lose.
 But someone outside the court may use Back
 at the instant that the last player is hit.
 Okay.
 Hisoka...
 Yes, I understand.
 We leave him for last.
 He throws a strong ball.
 Numbers 2, 6, and 7 can't catch it.
 Nice and strong!
 If we're lucky, we can take out
 6 and 7 at the same time!
 Th-They combined?
 You're strong.
 Is that allowed?!
 It is.
 If you're allowed to combine,
 are you allowed to split?
 Yes, but you cannot surpass the maximum
 number of players on the court.
 Now!
 It's my turn to attack again.
 Now we have to retake the ball again.
 If we're going to stop his ball...
 Ken!
 Their Nen is smooth and quite beautiful.
 They must have trained hard.
 But if Razor throws the ball at full strength,
 Ken won't be enough.
 They must be prepared for casualties
 when they recover the ball
 and try to defeat him.
 Is it even possible?
 So you know how to use Ken.
 That means you won't die.
 However...
 That assumes you aren't hit in the wrong spot.
 Here I come,
 Gon!
 Bring it!
 It won't work! Run away!
 You'll die!
 Ko!
 Gon!
 Where's the ball?
 Crazy...
 It's drilled in there.
 Gon!
 Are you okay?!
 I'm just fine!
 The hell you are...
 I used Ko to harden my arms and head,
 but my legs couldn't take the impact.
 However,
 next time,
 I'll catch it!
 Gon is now fired up.

 Guts x And x Courage
 An intense dodgeball match has begun.
 Gon was injured by Razor's throw,
 but his eyes burn with fire.
 Estimating the ball's likely drop point...
 Play will resume with Team Gon's
 inside players controlling the ball.
 But as the ceiling is considered
 an extension of the floor,
 Gon is out.
 I'm going to use Back.
 But you're...
 I'm doing it!
 He won't listen to us...
 Fine... However!
 Don't use Back until we're
 down to two inside players!
 Got it?
 Now let's start.
 Gon, get patched up.
 It isn't against the rules to keep
 passing the ball like this, is it?
 That is okay.
 All right, I'm good now.
 Hey!
 I'm the type that tends to hold grudges.
 Time for payback, Razor!
 Take this...
 Black Goreinu!
 So he can swap the black
 one with other people?
 You got me good...
 That's what you get.
 You're out of there!
 He's out, but he's still able to return inside.
 At least we can force him to use up his Back.
 And the ball is in our outside territory.
 Huh?
 What?
 Goreinu!
 You have an interesting ability.
 You should use it wisely.
 Hold on! What was that?!
 There's no rule against passing
 the ball to an opponent.
 And you're allowed to hit
 people in the face here.
 So his attack was also legal.
 Had the ball touched the floor, I'd be out.
 Once the user's unconscious,
 the Nen beast disappears.
 As I suspected, his ability works with
 his direct control, not automatically.
 If he regains consciousness,
 the black ape may begin inside the court.
 I don't anticipate that happening, though.
 If the interior players are reduced
 to zero before Goreinu wakes up,
 the match will be decided.
 It's impossible...
 Even if he comes to, he won't be in any condition
 to remake his Nen beast right away.
 Inside the court, it's three versus three.
 But we're obviously outmatched.
 Half our players are gone,
 and we only have one
 injured kid on the outside.
 Our opponents have a solid outside team,
 so they can attack from anywhere.
 Razor is still inside,
 without needing to use Back.
 And the ball rebounded to our opponents.
 We're at a clear disadvantage!
 Well, then...
 Who is
 up next?
 Me?
 What do I do?
 It's impossible! I can't catch that!
 I have to dodge!
 It made a sharp turn?
 Hisoka!
 Bungee Gum!
 That bastard...
 He got us good.
 He faked going for me,
 when his real goal was taking out
 Bisky and Hisoka in a straight line.
 Actually, he could have
 gambled that I'd dodge left.
 Had I done that...
 Bisky is out!
 Move to the outside court.
 What?
 Didn't she dodge?
 My own fault.
 Huh?
 This means your clothes count
 as part of your body, right?
 Yes.
 I was certain she'd dodged it...
 We're down to two!
 You can't let them get the ball!
 Back!
 Gon has used Back.
 He may move back inside.
 Can we really trust a kid with this?
 He's no ordinary kid...
 He's the only one who's even
 tried to catch Razor's throw.
 Are you all right?
 Yeah.
 Listen to me.
 Do not overdo it!
 Yeah.
 What's one plus one?
 Yeah.
 This is hopeless.
 Okay!
 Beat him, even if it kills you!
 Osu.
 You okay?
 Yep.
 I've discovered something.
 If the ball travels outside the court,
 it becomes much less powerful.
 Without using Ko, I only injured a couple fingers.
 Then if we avoid Razor's throws,
 we will avoid any significant damage.
 Exactly so.
 That won't be a victory.
 Huh?
 Don't be stupid...
 If we can't win no matter what
 we do, all this is pointless!
 You'd better cool down, stupid.
 Aren't you mad?
 Huh?!
 If you'd dodged left, you could've died.
 Right?
 I'm really pissed off...
 I won't settle for some cheap win.
 We have to utterly destroy him!
 You must have a plan in mind...
 Yeah.
 I've got this.
 Killua, stand over there.
 Plant yourself firmly, and hold the ball.
 Okay.
 I get it!
 First comes rock!
 His aura just spiked!
 Rock, paper...
 Rock!
 First comes rock!
 His aura just spiked!
 Rock, paper...
 Rock!
 Number 13 is out.
 Catching the ball while touching the area
 outside is illegal and does not count.
 Play will resume with Team Gon's
 outside players controlling the ball.
 Wow!
 He sent the biggest one flying.
 Damn it...
 That wasn't good enough!
 He looks unhappy...
 He's actually upset.
 That kid's really got guts.
 Not enough yet...
 Not enough to defeat the real Razor!
 I need more power!
 Okay, let's do it again.
 Give it to Razor good!
 Yeah.
 To beat Razor,
 I'll need a lot more power.
 Ren.
 What?
 His aura is immense.
 You may have chosen the wrong sport.
 He has all the time in the
 world to build up his power.
 You might want to dodge this one.
 You must be joking.
 Focus all the refined aura
 into my fist.
 First comes rock!
 Take this, Razor!
 Rock!
 Paper...
 Rock!
 Perfect!
 No way he'll catch that!
 He's receiving it?
 He used his own body to reduce its power.
 Nice move.
 That required perfect timing.
 But he was able to pull it off.
 This man truly is strong.
 Amazing...
 You can do more than just
 dodge or catch the ball.
 But I doubt that tip will help you.
 That ball was as strong as Razor's,
 but it didn't even reach the ceiling.
 He managed to burn off enough
 momentum with that receive.
 Now the ball's directly over him!
 Bungee gum.
 Too bad for you.
 You have to catch the ball, after all.
 As dictated by the cushion effect, Razor is out.
 Step to the outside.
 Back.
 Razor has used Back!
 He remains inside.
 Both teams have used Back,
 and it's three-on-two!
 The tables have turned!
 Really?
 Our team is the one on the ropes.
 Hisoka probably isn't in any shape to throw.
 No, he probably can't even hold
 the ball with his right hand.
 Gon's attacks used immense amounts of aura.
 He should be starting to feel tired about now.
 For him to be able to make another,
 equally strong throw is unlikely.
 So Killua is the only uninjured
 player left on the inside?
 No, you have it backwards.
 He's probably sustained the most damage of all.
 What do you mean?
 You okay, Gon?
 Yeah, but we need one more... I think.
 I'll put everything into this one.
 All right!
 This time, end it.
 One more throw...
 I can take it.
 Just hold out!
 When Gon launched his ball,
 Killua barely used any
 protective Nen on his hands.
 That's insane.
 You saw the power of that launch...
 Like a cannon opening fire!
 Correct.
 Essentially, he used his bare hands
 to form the cannon's barrel.
 Had Killua used a significant amount
 of Nen to protect his hands,
 his aura would have become a
 barrier against Gon's punch,
 reducing the power to the ball.
 In order to avoid weakening the ball,
 Killua used hardly any aura on his hands.
 Killua's hands must be in far worse shape
 than Hisoka's right hand.
 Damn... I'm a fool!
 How could I not be over there?
 I know the technique.
 And I can do it faster than Killua.
 In the instant before Gon touches the ball,
 you can apply a lightning-fast coat of
 aura to your hands for protection!
 Wait!
 Time out!
 Ref, I have a question.
 What is it?
 Can inside players choose
 to move to the outside?
 That doesn't violate any rules,
 but you can't return inside.
 Right... Come here!
 Gon, if you come outside,
 I can hold the ball for you.
 Killua's hands must be ravaged by now.
 I doubt he's in any condition
 to hold the ball for you.
 I know how to apply a lightning-fast coat of aura
 in order to protect my hands.
 I'll hold the ball, and you can
 take Razor out from here.
 It's our only way to win.
 We can't do that.
 Yeah.
 Wh-Why not?
 Where's the problem?
 It would be a cop-out.
 Huh?
 This isn't the time to worry about that!
 Don't overdo it, pops.
 You took a pretty big hit.
 I'm doing fine.
 I'm not hurting as much as you think.
 Then show me your hands.
 I'm all right.
 Look!
 He can't feel anything but pain.
 I can do this!
 I can take one more ball.
 Gon, I can do this!
 It's impossible!
 Gon, help me convince him.
 I already knew...
 I knew Killua's hands were messed up.
 Tsezgerra-san,
 I'm sorry, but I won't move outside.
 I need Killua to hold the ball.
 He's the only one who can do it!
 If Bisky or Hisoka held it,
 I probably couldn't use my full strength.
 The only reason I can focus
 wholly on hitting the ball
 is because Killua's holding it for me.
 So, got it now, pops?
 Go get some rest.
 I understand.
 I'm counting on you!
 Hisoka, give me the ball.
 We will now resume the match.
 Honestly, I'm not too good at throwing!
 Now we're even.
 Brilliant!
 She hit him at just the right angle
 so the ball would rebound to us.
 Number 2 is out!
 That leaves only...
 Razor alone!
 Gon, we need to regain
 the ball from Razor first.
 Of course.
 One sec.
 I understand. That sounds interesting.
 I'm not sure it'll work, though...
 Oh, but I would so love to try it.
 Let's give it a shot, Killua.
 Okay.
 Then it's settled.
 Man, you always come up
 with the craziest ideas.
 Counting on you, Killua.
 We will resume the match now.
 Gon and Killua share a strong bond of trust.
 What sort of team play will emerge
 when their friendship is backed
 by the addition of Hisoka?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Contact.
 Contact
 Communicate with one target
 player (encountered within the
 game) via your Book. (Connection
 maintained for a maximum
 of 3 minutes. May only be
 broken by player who uses card.)
 [LR][NORM]
 It uses your Binder to let you
 contact any player you've met.
 What are you doing?
 Contacting aliens.
 Wow, it worked!
 Continue!
 Next time: Bargain x And x Deal.
 Let's do this, Killua!
 Are you ready, Hisoka?
 Yes.
 Unite!

71,"We will now resume the match.
 Razor's Nen beasts...
 Are vanishing.
 He drew the aura he'd
 dispersed back into himself.
 So his next throw will use his true strength.
 Bargain x And x Deal
 The match begins once again.
 What is Gon's plan to retake the ball from Razor?
 I didn't expect I'd need to use this...
 It's been a long time
 since I've felt this good!
 He threw the ball straight up?
 Does that mean...
 He's going for a spike?
 Hey, over there.
 They're literally going to...
 Combine!
 I see what you're attempting.
 Then it's a contest to determine
 the winner!
 Their plan is
 for Gon to catch the ball.
 For Hisoka to smother it...
 And for Killua to provide support!
 They did it!
 They stopped it!
 Way to go!
 I have to applaud them for that.
 They overcame my power using their wits.
 And the key to their success
 was that boy Killua.
 Gon focused aura on his
 hands to catch the ball.
 The incredible concentration and focus
 it took to pull that off deserve my praise.
 The moment Gon caught it,
 Hisoka used his power to smother the ball's
 momentum so Gon wouldn't drop it.
 Had his technique been less than perfect,
 the ball would have flown off.
 And Killua...
 He was stuck between them,
 acting as both a cushion and a brace,
 balancing his aura between
 offensive and defensive.
 If the aura around his body had been too weak,
 he would have failed to work as a cushion,
 and all three of them would have taken
 major damage from the ball's impact.
 But if he hadn't used enough aura on his legs,
 he would have failed to act as a
 brace, and the ball would have
 knocked all three of them outside the court.
 He needed to analyze how to balance
 his aura between body and legs
 within one-percent accuracy.
 A feat that demanded both experience and talent.
 But Killua managed to compensate for
 his inexperience with his prodigious talent,
 allowing him to overcome such a difficult task.
 His talent is scary.
 I didn't reach that point until
 I was in my late twenties...
 I have to beat them before they can combine.
 Right after their attack, my chance will come.
 If I can get them at that moment,
 they won't have time to combine.
 Certainly, Gon's throw is powerful,
 but now I have the power to catch
 it without being pushed back.
 Then I can pick them off one at a time.
 I need more power...
 More...
 More!
 He didn't use his full strength earlier?
 Unbelievable...
 He's a monster.
 Ging, you should be happy.
 This kid is definitely your son.
 Killua, I'm going all-out.
 You'd better!
 If you don't, I'll smack you!
 First comes rock!
 Rock,
 paper...
 Rock!
 More powerful than anticipated.
 But I can catch it!
 However, the momentum
 will force me out of bounds!
 So catching isn't an option,
 but I can't dodge, either!
 Come...
 Trying to receive it again?
 Fool, that'll let Hisoka grab it!
 I wouldn't be so sure...
 That depends on
 the direction in which I direct it!
 He bounced it back!
 Gon, dodge!
 You'll still win!
 No, he won't dodge.
 That isn't how he wants to win.
 During this match, I've learned
 that much about him.
 He's unconscious?
 Oh, right.
 It was the aura he expended...
 He truly used every ounce of strength.
 You can take pride in this.
 You've won, Gon.
 Not quite yet.
 Why would you do that?!
 He desired total victory.
 Right, Gon?
 He bounced it back again!
 Interesting.
 Are we just rallying now?
 It'll come down to stamina!
 The ball is stuck...
 Bungee Gum possesses the properties
 of both rubber and gum.
 Razor, catching the ball while touching the
 area out of bounds is against the rules.
 You're out!
 Which makes Team Gon
 the winner of this match!
 All right!
 That was amazing, guys!
 Huh?
 What happened at the end?
 They beat me good...
 Oh, so Hisoka finished the job.
 In the end, he stole all the glory.
 It was only possible with all of your help.
 Call this a victory for the team.
 That doesn't sound like you at all.
 You beat me.
 As promised, we'll leave the city.
 Oh, yeah...
 That was this game's purpose.
 But first,
 I will answer your question about Ging.
 Ow!
 Honestly, you were so reckless!
 Your hands are a total mess.
 Hey, are you listening?
 The answer is that Ging isn't here.
 Nor do I know where he is.
 Oh...
 Well, I was expecting that.
 But I can tell you some stories that I know.
 Yes, please!
 I, too, was a death row convict.
 I was a murderer.
 I'd been arrested, jailed, and sentenced to die,
 when Ging hired me to come here.
 Ging taught me it took only one person,
 one person in the entire world who will trust you,
 to save you.
 My son will come here one day.
 When that happens, give him a good beating.
 Does that mean I'm allowed to kill him?
 Don't get too cocky.
 He is my son.
 Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.
 I always thought your old man was insane.
 He'd spend hours with a death
 row convict going on and on
 about a game he made, like a kid would.
 And then he hired that convict
 to fight his own son.
 Scum! Who do you think is letting you live?
 Hey...
 You!
 Over there!
 Oh, that...
 Then, I'm counting on you, Razor.
 It felt like no one had ever
 called me by name before.
 Ging believed in your strength,
 so he left you to me.
 And I believed in your strength,
 which is why I didn't hold back.
 Yeah, but I couldn't have won
 without everyone else.
 That was some good teamwork.
 Yeah.
 Gon, go find Ging.
 Yep!
 This is the place.
 A window?
 We can see the shore from here.
 How do we reach the Sea God's Grotto from here?
 Directly below the point on the
 surface the light points to.
 There's a grotto down there.
 But there isn't any treasure there.
 I'm sorry I deceived you.
 Really?
 It's a sacred cavern,
 so only a few fishermen know the location.
 All other stories you heard were
 rumors made up by others.
 Including the stories of treasure.
 But Razor and his gang wouldn't believe us.
 Those who make their living on
 the sea can never defile it.
 So they said before they were all killed,
 taking the secret with them.
 Hey...
 You get that this is a story in a game, right?
 I can finally see the ocean again from here.
 The sunrise...
 The boats returning with their hauls...
 The water sparkling in many colors.
 In my mind, this view is the true treasure.
 Patch of Shore
 The entrance to an
 underwater cavern known
 as the Sea God's Grotto.
 The cavern changes
 every time you enter.
 Yes! We got Patch of Shore!
 Let's use Clone to make two copies.
 We're fine with taking the copies.
 Yes, you've earned the right to the original.
 Hisoka, you really don't want anything?
 No, it was quite fun.
 Why don't you join us?
 I'm curious about the Troupe's actions.
 I'm not interested in collecting cards.
 Should anything else come up,
 use Contact to reach me.
 I'll use Accompany or Magnetic
 Force to come at once.
 Huh?
 That liar!
 Huh?
 We haven't used Magnetic Force
 at all since Hisoka joined, right?
 That means he already knew about
 spell cards before he ran into us!
 Killua,
 there are liars who only lie
 when there's a reason to,
 and there are liars who also lie without reason.
 You and I are the former.
 He is the latter.
 You won't get anywhere by fretting over it.
 Another player has used Contact to reach you.
 It's been a while.
 Do you know who this is?
 Genthru?
 What do you want?
 First, I'd like to congratulate you.
 What are you talking about?
 Don't bother playing dumb.
 I promise to spare your lives.
 In return, hand over Patch of Shore.
 Don't be ridiculous.
 Well, I am somewhat interested
 to see if you can beat us.
 If you're willing to deal,
 come alone to Masadora's entrance in one hour.
 If you don't, we'll take the card by force.
 You cannot escape us.
 We have many copies of Accompany.
 How?
 I knew he'd find out, but not this soon!
 Asta, Amana, Manheim,
 Nick Cue, Souheil, Kazsule...
 They were all members of
 your party of fifteen.
 Isn't that right?
 Check your Binder.
 They're no longer with us.
 Book!
 This means they're either dead
 or no longer in the game...
 Genthru!
 Who are you?
 Gon Freecss!
 I'll take you on!
 Gon?
 So you're one of those three kids.
 It appears you have Lucky Alexandrite.
 Once I'm done with Tsezgerra, I'll come for you.
 Or do you want to give up the card now?
 You come here this instant!
 I'll fight you!
 I also have—
 Tsezgerra, can you move somewhere else?
 Another player has used Contact to reach you.
 This is Phinks.
 We found him.
 I'm heading your way.
 Wouldn't it be faster to target the kids?
 They probably have a copy of Patch of Shore.
 But it would be a card created by Clone.
 That's true.
 Once those kids see Tsezgerra
 surrender, they'll give up.
 If we go after the kids first,
 Tsezgerra will have time to recover,
 and that will just give us more trouble.
 He is a Single Star Hunter.
 And we don't know what his power is.
 Genthru doesn't know your strength.
 So he believes that we are carrying
 the original Patch of Shore.
 They want the original card...
 they want ""our"" card.
 We'll try to buy as much time as possible.
 Use the time to regain your strength.
 If you want to beat this game, you'll
 have no choice but to fight them.
 And you are the only ones
 with a chance to win.
 But, Gon...
 Just now, your actions were
 both selfish and foolish.
 If they'd accepted your challenge and come,
 what would have happened
 to Killua, given his injuries?
 You endangered not only yourself,
 but your friends too, by losing
 control of your emotions!
 I'm sorry.
 Very well.
 It will all come down to Accompany.
 If we evade their use of Accompany,
 we should be able to buy plenty of time.
 But if too much time passes,
 they may decide to switch and target you.
 I estimate we have a one-week limit.
 Past that, we can't make guarantees.
 One week...
 That isn't long.
 And that's probably optimistic.
 They may well switch to us after three days.
 I'll go with Tsezgerra.
 What about you guys?
 If we're buying you time,
 that implies we have an alliance.
 No, wait.
 There is little benefit from an alliance with them.
 The enemy already knows the
 eight of us have teamed up.
 So we won't be able to act as decoys
 while you take out Genthru.
 That means leaving the original versions
 of the last two cards they seek,
 #2 and #75, with any one
 party would be dangerous.
 So my offer to buy time isn't an alliance.
 I'm offering a deal.
 A deal?
 Three weeks...
 That's the amount of time we can buy.
 If we succeed, will you give
 us #75, Lucky Alexandrite?
 That doesn't make sense.
 You just said one week was the limit.
 That's assuming we stay on the run.
 If necessary, I can force a stalemate of sorts.
 I see.
 But for #75, we could just
 tell you how to obtain it.
 No, we already know how.
 But Goreinu and the rest of us
 have few empty slots left.
 It's no longer reasonable to turn
 all our cards over to the villagers.
 Three weeks.
 That isn't enough time for
 Killua's hands to heal.
 And it certainly isn't enough to close the
 gap between Genthru's abilities and ours.
 Which means we should use the
 time to come up with a plan.
 Exactly.
 Devise a scenario in which
 you can defeat Genthru.
 Identify the required circumstances,
 and prepare to carry out that plan.
 Got it.
 Good...
 We'll leave to delay Team Genthru now.
 Keep this in mind, Gon...
 They've already killed over
 fifty players in this game.
 If you want to beat the game,
 you'll have to fight them.
 Accompany on!
 To Masadora!
 Three weeks... That isn't much time.
 Killua, you focus on healing
 and thinking of a plan to defeat Genthru.
 Right.
 Gon, you train with me.
 The first necessity is that you be
 able to avoid his Little Flower.
 Osu!
 Gon has won his match against Razor.
 But the bombers remain stronger
 fighters than Gon's group.
 Will they be able to devise a viable plan?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Clone.

 selected from the restricted slots
 of one target player. If target has
 empty restricted slots or max of

 Clone is used up without transforming.

 Machi and Nobunaga are tailing him.
 He's just up ahead.
 We'll let you negotiate with the exorcist.
 We're willing to pay any price he asks.
 Anyway, just make sure he agrees to do it.
 I understand.
 After all, I won't get to fight Chrollo otherwise...
 Chase x And x Chance
 That's him.
 How did you find him?
 Hell if I'll tell you, fool.
 You in the shadows,
 was it through your power?
 You didn't even use En.
 Are you some kind of freak?
 I recently completed a very entertaining battle.
 I'm quite sensitive at the moment...
 To calm myself down,
 I rather feel like messing up
 a complete stranger.
 Damn.
 Come on out.
 Was my Zetsu not good enough?
 No, it was perfect.
 This guy is just insanely perceptive.
 Here is Troupe member #4.
 In other words, your replacement.
 My name is Kalluto.
 I cannot tell you how my power works,
 but we found him by using it.
 Ah...
 You look very appetizing as well.
 Be careful.
 He certainly isn't picky.
 Hisoka, you'd better succeed.
 You people are so tedious.
 I certainly shall, for my own benefit.
 Are you serious about fighting the boss?
 Of course I am.
 Would you prefer that I survive,
 or that Chrollo survives?
 A stupid question.
 Once you finish your job here,
 you can die, for all I care.
 And if I kill Chrollo, then what?
 That would be impossible.
 But I'll answer your question.
 I would pursue you to the ends
 of the Earth to kill you.
 I like the sound of that...
 Our objective is
 to obtain Breath of Archangel,
 currently monopolized by Team Genthru.
 We must force them to transform a card,
 or we won't have a chance to use our Voucher.
 And that's where Team Gon comes in.
 While they may not have the
 strength to win outright,
 they are highly likely to deal serious
 damage to a member of Team Genthru.
 If they're forced to use a Breath of Archangel,
 Voucher
 A voucher that can be
 exchanged for Breath
 of Archangel. Can only
 be obtained when
 Breath of Archangel
 has attained its card
 transformation limit.
 our Voucher will become a Breath of Archangel.
 Breath of Archangel
 An angel that cures any
 mortal injury or terminal
 illness with one breath.
 But angel only appears once.
 After that...
 We only need Lucky Alexandrite!
 And if we can buy three weeks for those kids,
 they'll trade the card to us!
 Yes.
 Right, it's time.
 Let's get going.
 Cards Needed
 Patch of Shore
 Lucky Alexandrite
 I believe I told you to come alone.
 We weren't able to make a decision,
 Cards Needed
 Breath of Archangel
 Lucky Alexandrite
 Blue Planet
 so we kept discussing it on our way here.
 And we've finally reached a consensus.
 We choose to fight!
 Levy on!
 Accompany on!
 To Antokiba!
 Book.
 Check your cards.
 Book!
 It's okay.
 They only stole some useless
 cards from my free slots.
 Same here.
 I didn't lose anything important.
 Guess that settles it.
 We take their cards and kill them.
 They'll put up a fight.
 Huh?
 I don't know what's happened to them...
 But their resolve was written all over their faces.
 Six copies of Accompany,
 twenty-four of Return,
 nine copies of Castle Gate,
 and two of Magnetic Force.
 I spent all our money on them.
 Okay, then we'll meet up in three days.
 Use that time to earn money
 and buy the cards we need.
 Got it.
 Do you think they'll come after us?
 Not immediately.
 We now have nearly twice the number
 of Accompany cards as Genthru.
 If they use Clairvoyant Serpent, they'll see that.
 Just you watch, Genthru...
 This is how a Single Star Hunter fights.
 A Few Days Later
 Gyo!
 Too slow!
 Don't stop to think after I grab your arm.
 Act the second you feel my touch!
 Osu!
 Too slow.
 Osu!
 You're still too slow!
 Osu!
 Okay, let's take a ten-minute break.
 Next, we'll start Emitter training.
 Osu.
 He's building his stamina...
 But in the mere two weeks we have left,
 I can only help him bolster his defense.
 We need another weapon before we can fight.
 Emitter training, level two.
 Elevation!
 You must maintain this stance,
 while staying perfectly still,
 and only by releasing aura.
 If you can elevate around
 at least that high, you pass.
 Okay!
 That training is a lot harder,
 given that it's only a level higher.
 Naturally... Because this is
 really level-five training.
 Five?
 Are you sure you should skip levels like that?
 Well, it's a gamble.
 If it doesn't work, we'll have wasted
 the three weeks we were given.
 If we followed the proper sequence,
 he could reach level three easily.
 But that wouldn't do him any
 good in actual combat.
 He needs an Emitter attack that
 can push an opponent back
 several meters with a direct hit.
 It must be that strong for
 him to use it as a weapon.
 So you jumped to level five...
 But even if he clears the training,
 the ability to send enemies flying
 isn't a desicively lethal weapon.
 Exactly right.
 It's only meant to give him more options.
 So have you made any progress on a plan?
 First, can you tell me what your power is?
 My job will be easier with that information.
 I'll introduce you to my power.
 Magical Esthetician Cookie-chan.
 She specializes in providing
 massages of pure pleasure.
 She'll burn off excess fat and guide both

 to cleanse your body internally.
 Constipation, stiff shoulders, chills...
 any anomaly you have will vanish!
 That's it?
 Of course not!
 She can also do chiropractic massages,
 meditative massages, rolling massages...
 And there's still much more!
 Are you an idiot?!
 That's totally worthless!
 What are you talking about?!
 That's the most useful power in the world!
 This is why you're just a stupid old hag!
 I dare you to say that again!
 Return on!
 To Soufrabi!
 Wait up!
 Was it them again?
 Damn, they're getting pretty blatant...
 They're definitely targeting us!
 That isn't the issue.
 How do they know where to find us?
 If they were using Accompany or Magnetic
 Force to move straight to us, we'd know,
 but that isn't the case.
 They're using hit and run tactics,
 then making clean escapes.
 We immediately move to a different location,
 but before long, they find us.
 They're using Nen.
 If they aren't using a spell,
 like homing or tracking,
 one of their members must have
 a Nen power similar to radar.
 We can't defend against that!
 What do we do?
 We'll just have to use some force.
 That's one copy of Accompany...
 Take all his C-rank cards.
 Okay, we'll set Steal on his binder...
 He hasn't met them before.
 Then he's clean.
 Hey, have you heard of the bombers?
 Yes, I've heard the rumors...
 We are the bombers.
 I just set a bomb on you.
 I can kill you from anywhere, anytime I wish.
 If you don't want to die,
 bring me the cards I request.
 Hey, here's another Accompany!
 I'll set Steal in here....
 Kess
 Tsezgerra
 Rodriot
 Uh-oh!
 Too bad!
 You're out!
 Crap...
 What are those bastards thinking?!
 They're camping outside the spell card store.
 And they're attacking every player who
 walks out with newly bought cards.
 Contact
 Communicate with one target
 player (encountered within the
 game) via your Book. (Connection
 maintained for a maximum
 of 3 minutes. May only be
 broken by player who uses card.)
 [LR][NORM]
 This is pure speculation.
 But they must be aware of me.
 They've realized that someone new is
 providing cards to Team Tsezgerra.
 So to flush me out,
 they check the binders of
 anyone who exits the store,
 disposing of everyone who's met one of you.
 They also steal their cards.
 They're primarily focused on obtaining
 Accompany and Magnetic Force.
 And any players that they free
 once cleared of suspicion
 are forced to collect cards for them.
 By eliminating suspects and taking their cards,
 they also cut off our supply.
 They're killing three birds with one stone.
 Got it.
 We'll try to track their movements.
 Get away from there and
 wait for us to contact you.
 Silent Worker: Fly on the Job
 They don't appear to be leaving Masadora.
 Okay, next we check their cards.
 Together, those three have
 sixteen copies of Accompany
 and two of Magnetic Force.
 That's a significant increase...
 At this pace, they'll catch up
 to us in four to five days.
 But we expected that.
 They're saying they won't move
 until they have enough cards.
 Everything is going well.
 Twelve days left.
 It's not working...
 Listen to me.
 While training, see yourself firing a water pistol.
 You build up aura within your body,
 then shoot it from your palm!
 The greater your power,
 the stronger the aura you fire.
 You want to release all the aura
 you've kept closed up inside.
 The total amount of refined
 aura you apply to the attack,
 and the speed, power, and timing
 you apply to the release...
 You need all of those elements
 to land the attack you'll require.
 It's too hard!
 I just don't get how you push the aura
 in your body out of your hand...
 He hasn't made any progress for ten days.
 Maybe you should have let
 him start from level two.
 We still have ten more days...
 Only if Tsezgerra can deliver.
 In hindsight, it wasn't a very good deal.
 If we give Team Tsezgerra Lucky Alexandrite,
 they'll only be missing two cards.
 We still need over thirty...
 We can just take them from Genthru by force.
 Gon would never accept that...
 And we still have to figure out
 how to defeat Genthru first.
 That's true.
 So is this big enough?
 Yeah.
 A Few Days Later
 We now have forty-eight copies of Accompany.
 If you total their Accompany, Return,
 and Magnetic Force cards,
 they only have forty-five cards.
 Now they can't evade us.
 Let us start a game of tag we cannot lose.
 Accompany on!
 Tsezgerra!
 They're on the move!
 They're coming our way at an incredible speed!
 We move according to the plan!
 Accompany on!

 Roger that.
 Accompany on!
 To Soufrabi!
 Damn, we only have five days left...
 Don't you have any advice that
 could help him break through?
 The sensation of aura flowing through the body
 is different for everyone.
 If I give him advice from my own perception
 and he makes incorrect assumptions,
 it could end up hurting more than helping.
 How many do we have left?
 Seven copies of Accompany.
 They aren't coming...
 Did they give up?
 No way.
 They're taking their time to throw us off.
 If we run out of Accompany,
 we'll have to use Return.
 Understood.
 We'll alternate between Aiai and Soufrabi.
 How's it going over there?
 Let's find out.
 Contact on.
 Goreinu.
 This is Tsezgerra.
 How's it going there?
 You were right.
 Sub and Bara have appeared.
 Most likely the real ones.
 They're speculating that I'll try to buy
 cards while they're playing tag.
 Which means it's Genthru and a couple
 of fakes that are chasing you.
 Then Tsezgerra's predictions were accurate!
 The same trick won't work again.
 Right now, Genthru is alone,
 while there are four of us.
 This is our chance!
 No, I would prefer better odds for a fight.
 We'll stick to the original plan.
 Here they come.
 We're back on the run!
 Gon...
 Time's up.
 Your training's over.
 We still have five days!
 Change in plans.
 I came up with a plan for defeating them.
 But... But...
 Uh, well...
 I think I've almost got it.
 Maybe...
 No, it isn't happening.
 And I can't use an unreliable
 technique in my plan...
 Give up.
 So the plan is...
 To use this.
 Huh?
 You'll have to learn this the hard way.
 Until you get it down to perfection.
 We're out of Accompany cards...
 Use Return!
 Return on!
 To Aiai!
 They're out of Accompany cards?
 We're finally getting close.
 Sub, Bara...
 How's it going? Catch anyone?
 Only one, and it was someone new to the game.
 Word's out that the bombers are hunting
 players around here, so everyone's staying away.
 Could he have been someone
 we already disposed of?
 Perhaps...
 Okay, come back.
 I'm in Soufrabi now.
 They're out of bullets.
 Leave
 Send one target player
 off the island.
 [SR][NORM]
 We're finally down to our last card.
 If they follow us outside the game,
 we can fend them off at the mansion.
 If they don't follow us, we just have
 to wait until the time limit is up.
 It's perfect...
 All that's left is choosing the
 three to keep for winning.
 We just have to ask Mr. Battera what he wants.
 Okay, let's go!
 Leave!
 No one's here.
 What's going on?
 Weren't armed guards standing by?
 Sabazushi, where are you?
 Answer if you're there!
 Sabazushi!
 Keep it down...
 I was taking a nap.
 A nap?
 What happened to everyone else?
 They left.
 Mr. Battera canceled the whole thing.
 We received an intermediary fee
 and a cancellation fee.
 But I stayed behind because I
 thought I should inform you.
 Canceled?
 Mr. Battera!
 What is the meaning of this?!
 We're so close!
 We're close to beating the game!
 It doesn't matter...
 Doesn't matter anymore.
 Doesn't matter?!
 That's crap!
 What about all the time and effort we've spent?
 My lawyers have been instructed to pay you.
 You can do whatever you want with the cards.
 So now,
 just leave me alone...
 Damn!
 What's going on?
 I don't know.
 Why did this happen?
 We're free to kill them out here.
 Since their ring data won't disappear.
 Team Tsezgerra has given Gon and his
 friends the time that they promised.
 But awaiting them was a
 situation they didn't expect.
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Fake.
 Fake
 Change Fake into any card type from 001 to 099.
 The new card can be placed in a restricted pocket.
 But it will not count toward Book completion,
 and cannot be transformed into an item.
 It also will not count toward card limit.
 [SR][NORM]
 It can transform into any card from 001 to 099.
 But it doesn't count toward binder completion.
 And it can't be transformed into an item.
 Funny face!
 Continue?
 Next time: Insanity x And x Sanity.
 Hey, Gon,
 want to see my special attack?
 I sure do!
 You'll have to wait till next week!
 Are you insane?

 Rodriot
 Barry
 Kess
 Today is the tenth day.
 If they don't return, their data will be erased.
 Well, I guess we have to wait
 for Goreinu to contact us.
 Yes! I got it!
 Look, I've got this down pat.
 Can I concentrate on Emitter training now?
 No!
 You might have it down, but you're
 still off by a tenth of a second.
 Your goal is to be within a hundredth of a second.
 Now start!
 Man...
 Another player has used Contact to reach you.
 Insanity x And x Sanity
 It's Goreinu.
 Sorry to keep you waiting.
 What's going on?
 Do you realize it'll soon have been 240 hours
 since Tsezgerra's team exited the game?
 Yeah.
 I can tell you now they won't be returning.
 Why not?
 Genthru's team is camping the starting point.
 We decided beforehand that they
 wouldn't return to the game
 until I sent an all clear signal.
 I understand.
 But their card data will disappear.
 I'm holding on to all the valuable cards.
 Doesn't that betray that they have other allies?
 They'll notice if none of the four
 have any important cards!
 They left the game at 3:05, ten days ago, right?
 Yeah, in five more minutes,
 their card data will be wiped.
 Essentially, they'll be out of it.
 To be safe, we'll wait until 3:10.
 But do you really think they've given up?
 Absolutely.
 Given that they took Battera and ran.
 It was a desperate attempt to
 keep us from the reward.
 But they spent years collecting
 those ninety-six cards.
 Also, I'm wondering why Battera
 would send his guards packing.
 No idea... Guess something happened.
 No point in speculating about it now.
 Oh, it's 3:10.
 Time's up.
 Yay!
 Bye-bye, Tsezgerra!
 Fake?
 Yeah,
 we switched about thirty of their
 ninety-six cards with fakes.
 I'm the one actually holding
 the ninety-six cards.
 For such a cautious man, this is the
 biggest gamble of Tsezgerra's life.
 So I want to make sure it pays off.
 I'm sorry, but I won't be able to
 help you face Genthru's crew.
 Understood.
 When do you want us to give you the card?
 I'll wait until you've defeated Genthru.
 Good luck.
 Accompany
 Warp all players within
 20 meters of caster to city
 (must have been visited)
 or player of your choice
 (must have been met
 inside the game).
 [SR][NORM]
 Now it's time to go after those kids.
 It wasn't in the plan, but we can
 get Patch of Shore from them.
 First, we need more copies of Accompany.
 Okay.
 They're on the move.
 Where are you right now?
 Near Soufrabi.
 They're heading toward Masadora.
 Once they're prepared, they'll come for you.
 Are you ready?
 Absolutely.
 We have you guys to thank.
 We need more time.
 But we have no choice. It'll depend on Gon.
 Gon!
 Did you let our conversation
 distract you and lose track?
 Please explain what this is about.
 I realize that I was being intrusive,
 but I took a look.
 Your daughter?
 Or perhaps your granddaughter?
 My lover.
 She'd been hospitalized for a long time.
 She was in a coma.
 A few days ago,
 she passed away in her sleep.
 I suppose she didn't want people
 thinking she wanted my money,
 because she returned every gift I gave her.
 But she loved
 this shoddy picture frame that I made myself.
 All we ever needed was one other.
 We swore that we would never be apart...
 Until the accident
 that put her into a sleep from
 which she'd never wake...
 Indeed...
 She appeared to only be sleeping...
 That was when I heard about Greed Island.
 Breath of Archangel
 An angel that cures any
 mortal injury or terminal
 illness with one breath.
 But angel only appears once.
 If I beat that game, I could obtain the one thing
 that I need most, like a dream come true.
 I was prepared to spend my
 fortune on copies of that game.
 But it doesn't matter any longer...
 It doesn't matter...
 The kids have four copies of
 Accompany among them.
 We have six.
 Shall we go, then?
 Yeah.
 Whenever you're ready.
 I'll take the kid with spiky black hair.
 Assuming we need to resort to force.
 Sub, take the slant-eyed kid.
 Bara, you take the girl.
 Accompany on!
 Gon!
 What do you want?
 Don't be so hostile.
 We're here to propose a deal.
 A deal?
 We aren't interested!
 Right, don't let them notice
 that we've been waiting for them,
 completely prepared.
 It's not a bad deal.
 We have a good idea that Tsezgerra approved.
 What is it?
 Interested now?
 Stop! Talk from where you are!
 Yes, that's good.
 We must act like we're at a
 significant disadvantage.
 We have to convince them
 that we're being forced into this position.
 It's quite simple.
 We'll beat the game on everyone's behalf,
 then everyone returns to the real world.
 And we'll split Battera's reward.
 I find that hard to believe.
 We've had a change of heart.
 And Tsezgerra has already left the game.
 But that doesn't prove that
 he agreed to your offer.
 You have a valid point.
 Then, what now?
 Do you want to die?
 Stop whining, and hand over your cards!
 Otherwise, we'll slaughter you!
 You've revealed your true colors.
 Book!
 Accompany on!
 To Soufrabi!
 Three more times.
 Two more times.
 One more time...
 Return
 Warp to a city
 of your choice.
 (Must be a city
 you have visited.)
 [LR][NORM]
 Return on!
 To Masadora!
 Masadora?
 Are they trying to obtain more spell cards?
 They might try to escape to the
 real world through the port.
 Accompany on.
 Gon!
 They're not here.
 Are they hiding and concealing their presences?
 Check at the store.
 We don't want to let them buy any spell cards.
 They haven't been here.
 Did they head for the port?
 Tsk, guess we have no choice.
 Accompany on!
 Gon!
 Don't lose sight of them!
 We're out of Accompany cards!
 Now why don't you give up,
 and hand over your cards?
 No way!
 We'll never let you have them!
 Everything's gone to plan.
 They mean to fight us one-on-one.
 If we have to hand over our
 cards, we'd rather fight!
 Wait, Gon!
 Damn...
 Good.
 Now we only need to separate them.
 Bisky, you run for it!
 B-But...
 Just run!
 Wait!
 Hey, you aren't getting away.
 I'm counting on you guys.
 You're up against me!
 You know that I'm the Bomber?
 I heard it from Tsezgerra.
 And who told you how my power works?
 Incredible.
 That moment was enough for him to know
 what I'm watching out for and why...
 This is the difference in experience between us!
 There aren't too many people
 who know about my power
 and are still alive.
 Book!
 I can't let him control things.
 I don't like people just taking
 cards from other players!
 So let's make a deal.
 Whoever surrenders first has
 to give up all his cards.
 You seem to have the wrong idea.
 You're in no position to make demands.
 This is your last chance to make a deal.
 Otherwise, you're nothing more than a thief.
 I'd rather die than hand
 over my cards to a thief!
 You can kill me, but I still
 won't take out my binder!
 You're insane.
 And I don't mean my kind of insane.
 Very well.
 You have a deal.
 Book.
 I'm holding one hundred thirty-one cards.
 I have ninety-seven of the restricted slot cards.
 I have one hundred and two cards.
 And seventy-one of the restricted slot cards.
 Book.
 You have #2 and #75, correct?
 Yeah.
 Book.
 That's all I need.
 An excellent show of Ren...
 But clearly, he has much
 room for improvement.
 Offense is the strongest defense.
 You're strong enough that
 a single explosion won't be
 enough to finish you off.
 So stay on the attack!
 This kid has skill.
 But his use of aura is sloppy at best.
 Not sure why he was so confident.
 At this point, you're nowhere near his level.
 You won't be able to deal significant damage.
 But continue to attack!
 Because he will still defeat you.
 You still haven't answered my question.
 Who told you about my power?
 Well, it isn't important now.
 My point is
 that I don't need my ability to deal with you.
 All according to plan.
 Once he's seen how much stronger he is,
 we'll begin to lure him into our trap!
 Osu!
 That's how I'd like to respond...
 But I don't like the idea of
 being totally manhandled.
 I'll make him use his power...
 I'll carry out the plan afterwards!
 Looks like you need a little more pain!
 Use your power.
 I have a surprise for you!
 I see what you're thinking.
 I won't use it!
 Damned kid!
 She's faster than I expected.
 Book!
 She should be out of teleportation spells.
 What's she doing?
 She used Transform to hide
 it as a different card?
 Accompany on!
 To Soufrabi!
 Accompany?
 Why?
 I don't get it...
 Why would you go to all this
 trouble to be alone with me?
 One reason...
 Because I didn't want to let you cry for help.
 Huh?
 I have no idea what you're talking about.
 You're such a fool...
 I'm telling you that I'm stronger.
 Damned brat!
 Your attacks are too weak...
 You can't defeat me!
 I won't hold back...
 So don't blame me.
 That's what I was going to say.
 I was being nice, so I let you hit me once.
 Because I can't restrain myself when I revert.
 And I end up killing my opponents!
 Oh, you're alive?
 I'm impressed.
 Why would you...
 hide your power?
 Two reasons...
 The ace up your sleeve should remain hidden...
 And more than anything, I hate the way I look.
 Too macho!
 Don't you agree?
 He can't hear me anymore?
 I have a slight advantage in martial
 skill and physical strength.
 But he has me beat in aura capacity.
 I probably won't be able to hurt
 him with any normal attack.
 Which makes him perfect to experiment on.
 Damn...
 I felt that hit inside my head.
 I can't afford to fool around.
 Wrong.
 Experiment #1...
 Lightning Palm!
 Lightning Palm
 Doesn't seem to be enough to knock him out.
 But I can immobilize him for a few seconds.
 Okay.
 Experiment #2...
 A yo-yo?
 Let's do this.
 What's he up to?
 What's that thing made of?
 This is a superalloy yo-yo my brother ordered.
 It weighs around fifty kilograms,
 so it packs quite a punch!
 Whoa!
 Damn...
 Between the weight and centrifugal
 force, that really hurts.
 He always leaves his right side exposed
 when I attack a certain way!
 If I take his yo-yo, leaving him empty-handed,
 he'll make the same mistake!
 My chance!
 There!
 Yes!
 Time to crush you!
 Oh?
 Did I forget to mention that I have two yo-yos?
 Wow, you're still conscious?
 Did you know that
 when you kick me, you raise your
 guarding arm on the other side?
 You're creating your own blind spot.
 He used my blind spot to pull
 out a yo-yo and attack?
 Then your defensive habit...
 Was a fake to make you
 kick me with your left leg.
 And when you released your first yo-yo...
 I knew you picked up something to throw at me.
 Why did you use Accompany to
 draw me away from the others?
 To make you focus on a one-on-one chance,
 so you'd lose track of your surroundings.
 I don't believe it..
 You set three traps during that brief exchange?
 Three?
 You must be joking...
 Every move I made was a trap.
 Experiment complete!
 Both work.
 Why won't you accept your fate?
 You can't beat me.
 No way.
 I...
 I haven't lost yet!
 I was mistaken.
 I take back what I said.
 You are strong...
 I will show you my power.
 This battle is mental, not physical.
 I must crush his will.
 His will to fight, his will to stand,
 his will to resist.
 Otherwise, he'll never admit defeat...
 To win, I must swallow my
 pride and play it smart.
 Let me demonstrate that all your hard
 work and confidence mean nothing!
 Here he comes.
 The devilish man has unleashed his true power.
 Can Gon emerge victorious?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Breath of Archangel.
 Breath of Archangel
 An angel that cures any
 mortal injury or terminal
 illness with one breath.
 But angel only appears once.
 A card that can cure injury and disease.
 Mito-san used this all the time.
 Huh?

74,"I must crush his will.
 His will to fight, his will to stand,
 his will to resist...
 Let me demonstrate that all your hard
 work and confidence mean nothing!
 Victor x And x Loser
 He's fast...
 I had no time to dodge!
 But I can still block his attacks!
 Oh? He used Gyo?
 The moment I grasped his arm,
 he focused his aura there to block my attack.
 Idiot!
 You think you've outwitted me now?!
 What's the matter?
 That was just a body blow.
 If you focus your aura where I grab you,
 you leave yourself open everywhere else.
 It's futile...
 In fact, you're only making
 it harder on yourself.
 Bisky was right!
 You won't be smiling much longer!
 One more hit to send you to hell!
 Impossible!
 That was the hardest hit so far!
 He shouldn't have been able to counter.
 But since he did, that means he
 kept the damage to a minimum.
 In other words, he blocked me
 without relying on aura.
 He guessed I didn't intend to set off a bomb?
 No, that wasn't a guess.
 Hey, Bisky...
 How does Genthru avoid being
 burned by his own bombs?
 That's quite simple.
 He shrouds his hand in aura that's
 stronger than the explosion.
 Oh... I get it.
 It's a technique that requires
 a large aura reserve.
 This is a good opportunity.
 By now, you should be able to tell.
 Excellent reaction!
 You've almost perfected Gyo.
 One more time, then.
 Huh?
 Could you tell the difference?
 Yeah, you used less aura the second time.
 Okay, you pass.
 You'll have an easier time with him
 if you can tell the difference.
 When Genthru prepares Little Flower,
 he will shroud his hand with Gyo.
 If he's just faking and planning
 to attack you somewhere else,
 he probably won't use Gyo.
 If you can tell if his hand is covered
 with Gyo when he grabs you,
 it'll be simpler for you to know
 which attack you should block.
 So that's it.
 You knew from my Gyo.
 Cunning.
 Let me repeat myself.
 The shallow strategy you're using will backfire.
 If you're caught by Little Flower when
 you aren't using enough aura to defend,
 a hit to the face will blow off your eyes,
 nose, and mouth with no hope of repair.
 A hit to the arms or legs will incinerate skin,
 severely damaging any nerves or muscle.
 You'll have no fingers or toes left.
 It's not possible for you to use Gyo to guard
 against every attack that uses Gyo.
 Now what?
 I'm not interested in continuing this.
 Fighting you has made me see something...
 You have talent and a promising future.
 And many other chances.
 Don't you think it's meaningless to throw
 all that away just for your pride?
 Just give up, stupid kid!
 If he makes like he's going to use
 both hands to blow you up,
 that's a red light.
 Then it'll be time to stick to the plan.
 Sorry, Bisky and Killua.
 I'm gonna be selfish here.
 I have to give it a try...
 Because I just had a great idea!
 If you seriously mean that,
 you should surrender, Genthru!
 A shame...
 Let me show you
 that there are some things worse than death.
 I'll blow up both your arms.
 Use Gyo to protect the one you want to keep.
 After that, I'll blow up your
 remaining arm and left leg.
 Use Gyo to protect the one you want to keep.
 And so on...
 Until you're out of limbs.
 Go ahead and try!
 Very well.
 Take this!
 Wh-What happened?
 Blood?
 Damage?
 He landed a hit?
 First comes rock!
 Crap...
 Move... Dodge!
 Rock...
 Paper...
 Rock!
 Did he hit me?
 No, I tripped.
 What was that?
 What just happened?
 Now I understand...
 Th-This kid...
 He sacrificed both hands!
 But the damage wasn't distributed evenly!
 He probably gave up completely on his left hand,
 protected his right hand with 30% of his aura,
 and focused the remaining 70% on his legs...
 to attack me!
 I use aura both to explode targets and
 to shield my hand from the blast.
 If I use it on both hands,
 I won't have much left for the rest of myself.
 He took advantage of that!
 Still, no one sane would actually try that!
 I gave him a pretty good scare!
 Damn...
 This hurts like hell.
 But...
 I'm going for it!
 I'm done...
 He's done?
 Is he giving up?
 Of course...
 That makes sense.
 He's lost his left hand,
 and his right is badly injured.
 And he managed to land a hit on me.
 He must be satisfied now.
 I'm done being selfish...
 Time to get serious!
 Let's do this, Genthru!
 Th-This kid's
 totally insane!
 Book!
 A card?
 He shouldn't have anything to concern me.
 The card transformed?
 Paladin's Necklace?!
 What is he planning?
 This is your last chance to surrender.
 Once I use this, you could end up dead.
 You're clearly bluffing!
 Now wait...
 This is my chance.
 Book.
 I give up.
 Obviously, you're never going to surrender.
 Take them.
 I'll silence him.
 Crushing his windpipe and
 knocking him out would be best.
 Then I can take the cards from his binder.
 I have one request.
 What is it?
 Could you leave me this card?
 Bah...
 He blocked my second attack with Gyo!
 But I did manage to crush his windpipe!
 He won't be able to use Book or Gain anymore.
 Genthru...
 You have made the worst mistake you could make.
 Gasoline
 A glass container
 filled with fuel.
 Highly flammable.
 One minute!
 What's that smell?
 He can't use Little Flower any longer.
 I'm going to take him down!
 Book.
 Oh, so this is gasoline...
 Very clever.
 True, I cannot use Little Flower now...
 However, I have another ability,
 Countdown.
 The ability that lets me set a bomb
 when I touch someone and say ""Bomber.""
 The bomb can only be disarmed
 by touching me and saying,
 ""I caught the Bomber.""
 This one is ten times stronger than Little Flower.
 You won't be able to block it with Nen.
 All the activation requirements have been met.
 If I touch you and say, ""Bomber,""
 the countdown will begin.
 Try to run away...
 If you still have the strength.
 The requirements have been met... for me!
 First comes rock...
 This is his earlier attack...
 If get too close, I'm done for.
 Is he trying to keep me back?
 Rock...
 Paper...
 Rock!
 A pitfall?
 But he's falling with me!
 It's deep...
 I can't climb back up.
 But he should be in the same boat.
 He's ended up cornering himself.
 He's gone.
 Genthru...
 If a card is removed from
 the binder for a minute,
 it reverts to an item.
 Large Rock
 A rock?!
 First comes rock...
 Rock...
 Paper...
 W-W-Wait!
 I surrender! I surrender!
 Rock!
 Osu!
 Are you awake?
 Summon your binder.
 We want you to return the cards you stole
 from the people you backstabbed.
 On one condition...
 Use Archangel to heal Bara.
 We have a Clone card.
 Don't worry.
 That was always part of the plan.
 We brought six copies of Clone.
 Book...
 Gain!
 What is your wish?
 We need you to heal his hands and throat.
 Actually, can you just heal all his injuries?
 Easily done.
 Then I shall heal his body.
 I'm healed!
 Then, farewell.
 All right!
 Okay, here's the extra Archangel.
 Gain!
 Next up is Killua.
 Genthru, we're going to use your binder.
 Go ahead.
 Clone on!
 Breath of Archangel has reached
 its maximum card limit.
 Clone will be destroyed.
 W-W-Wait!
 What's going on?!
 Did I do something wrong?
 No, it's Goreinu.
 Huh?
 He used Clone or Transform to increase the
 number of Breath of Archangel vouchers.
 So two of his vouchers became
 Breath of Archangel cards.
 Another player has used Contact to reach you.
 Yo, it's Goreinu.
 Looks like you won.
 But I don't approve of this.
 If you plan to use Breath of Archangel
 to heal these murderers,
 the trade is off!
 You okay with using it on me?
 Of course.
 I am an assassin.
 Eh?
 I've killed more people than these guys.
 Each player in this game risks their
 life in one way or another.
 That doesn't make it okay to kill others.
 But all the people I've killed were
 not nearly as prepared to die.
 I'm worse than these guys.
 No, you aren't like them.
 I like you, but I hate their guts!
 That isn't a valid reason!
 I don't need a reason...
 What counts is how I feel.
 Aren't you guys the same way?
 But we don't think it's right
 to let them die because we hate them.
 In battle, both sides risk their lives,
 and are prepared to kill.
 But that doesn't apply once the fight is over.
 I haven't forgiven Genthru for
 killing all those players...
 But the three of us agreed before the fight
 that we'd bring six Clone cards.
 I don't really remember why we decided that,
 but it wasn't based on logic or reason.
 It was just the decision that came naturally to us.
 Once the fight was over and we'd
 obtained Breath of Archangel,
 we planned to heal everyone.
 All three of us made the decision,
 so we wanted to stick to it.
 But I understand how you feel,
 and we can't change your mind.
 Sorry, Killua...
 Could you wait a little longer?
 No problem.
 I'll recover on my own in a while.
 The situation's changed, so we
 can't use Clone anymore.
 There's only one Breath of Archangel left.
 Only one? Isn't that the original?
 Use it on Genthru.
 I'm fine...
 Okay, let's use Accompany to go to Masadora.
 Yeah.
 Hey, wait up...
 Fine, you can have Breath of Archangel.
 Huh?
 Really? Are you sure?
 Yeah, actually...
 Before you told me all this,
 I planned to give it to you.
 Not just Archangel, but all of our cards.
 What?!
 Tsezgerra, his team, and I all agreed.
 We've decided to give up on the game.
 Wow, I'm completely healed!
 Oh, so Mr. Battera...
 Yeah, he paid Tsezgerra and his
 team for breaking his promise.
 I got four billion out of it.
 Four billion?!
 Hey...
 Share some of the wealth!
 Wh-What are you talking about?
 Each of the four of us gets one billion!
 Eh?!
 It's only fair...
 I couldn't have done this on my own.
 It was only possible because
 I teamed up with you guys.
 I can't believe it...
 You're such a nice guy!
 Anyway, you can take all the cards.
 On one condition!
 You must be the first players to beat the game.
 Yep!
 Not a problem.
 That gives you ninety-nine restricted slot cards.
 Leaving only #0.
 One card to go...
 Yeah.
 Ninety-seven, ninety-eight...
 And this is...
 Maid Panda
 A species on the
 verge of extinction.
 Tidy, loves to cook,
 and some individuals
 enjoy Western clothing
 and gardening.
 Excellent at taking
 care of human children.
 ninety-nine!
 This announcement is for all players.
 A player has collected ninety-nine
 restricted slot cards.
 Ten minutes from now, in honor of this event,
 there will be a quiz contest
 for all Greed Island players.
 There will be one hundred total questions
 dealing with restricted slot cards.
 The player who has the most
 correct answers will receive
 #0 Ruler's Blessing as a prize.
 Please wait with your binders open.
 Questions about restricted slot cards, huh?
 I get it.
 The questions are probably
 designed so that players
 who mainly stole cards can't answer them.
 Someone's coming!
 Wait, more over here!
 The long battle has finally
 reached its final stage.
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we introduce the card Transform.
 Transform
 Change one card in your possession into any
 other card in your possession. (Card will now
 count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
 and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
 [SR][NORM]
 You can change one card into any other card.
 Gon, quick!
 Transform on! Gold Dust Girl.
 Gold Dust Girl
 A girl who releases golden dust.
 One bath a day will net 500G.
 Very shy and quiet.
 Gain.
 G.I. Tutorial
 Continue!
 Next time: Ging's Friends x And x True Friends.
 Think I can make a hundred friends?
 You'll be fine.
 If your eyes meet, you're friends.

75,"Don't worry.
 We aren't here to get in your way.
 In fact, you could say we're here to help.
 Help?
 Yeah.
 If we get the top score on
 the quiz and win the card,
 we want to sell it to you for 2.5 billion.
 That's only five percent of your reward.
 It's a reasonable price, yeah?
 Oh, right...
 They haven't heard about Battera yet.
 Sure, if you get the top score.
 Everyone else is here for the chance
 to sell us the final card, too?
 With the game ending,
 they're all hoping to share in the reward.
 It looks like they're going
 to take the quiz in teams.
 What should we do?
 What? We should do it by ourselves.
 Yeah.
 Whoever scores lower gets penalized.
 Okay, I'm in!
 Honestly... They've got guts.
 They just came from a fight to the death,
 and now they're facing the final event
 in the game with such confidence.
 I bet those two enjoyed this
 game more than anyone.
 Keep it up.
 Ging's Friends x And x True Friends
 The quiz contest open to all players has begun.
 Then I will now start the quiz.
 Question one.
 What is the name of the elder
 who gives an important hint
 about #1, Patch of Forest?
 A: Hira.
 B: Hida.
 C: Hiso.
 D: Mayu.
 E: Hima.
 Damn! I'm stumped on the first one!
 Five choices?
 What is the condition to obtain
 #17, Breath of Archangel?
 I caught the Bomber.
 #84,
 Paladin's Necklace, is offered as a prize
 in a monthly tournament of what?
 Yes!
 B. Rock-Paper-Scissors
 C. Two-Man Tug-of-War
 D. Snowball Fight
 E. Kick the Can
 Okay!
 And now for the final question...
 What is the name of card #0?
 A: Ruler's Banquet.
 B: Ruler's Invitation.
 C: Ruler's Reception.
 Can't remember...
 C. Ruler's Reception
 D. Ruler's Welcome
 E. Ruler's Blessing
 The quiz is over.
 I will now announce the player with the top score.
 With a score of 87 out of 100 points,
 our top scoring player
 is Gon.
 Yes!
 We have all one hundred!
 You did it.
 I hate to say it, but you beat us...
 Congratulations.
 Thanks.
 That means Killua gets penalized.
 Damn...
 How many points did I get?
 Ruler's Invitation?
 Ruler's Invitation
 An invitation from
 this island's ruler.
 The envelope contains
 a map that shows the
 castle and a badge.
 Player must have badge
 to enter the castle.
 Looks like only the one with
 the badge is invited.
 So Limeiro is the capital?
 I have to go alone?
 We'll wait for you by the castle.
 Hey, he really got it.
 That kid really collected all the cards.
 Hey, let's have a contest with
 all your cards at stake.
 Sorry, but you don't have a choice.
 Then I'll take an Accompany card.
 Wait, that won't work.
 We haven't been to Limeiro before.
 So we should use Drift...
 Since we've been to the other cities before.
 Drift
 Transports you to a
 previously unvisited city.
 (If all cities have been
 visited, Drift is used,
 without transporting player.)
 [SR][NORM]
 In that case, I'll use Drift to go to Limeiro,
 then come back for you guys.
 Accompany will work after that.
 Drift on!
 Bingo!
 Accompany
 Warp all players within 20 meters
 of caster to city (must have been visited)
 or player of your choice (must have
 been met inside the game).
 [SR][NORM]
 Let's go, Gon.
 Yep.
 Accompany on!
 Limeiro!
 Those kids are amazing.
 They wiped the floor with the Belum brothers.
 Of course...
 They even defeated the bombers.
 It's true,
 those boys are much stronger
 than when I first met them.
 But they're still weaker than
 Genthru in raw power.
 They must have executed a brilliant plan...
 Well, no matter.
 I'll let you have the reward for beating the game.
 Magnetic Force on.
 Chrollo Lucilfer.
 I'll head back to reality and
 make a fortune exorcising Nen.
 I wonder what he's feeling.
 What he's feeling?
 He might meet Ging, after all.
 The father he's been searching for all this time.
 Welcome to Greed Island Castle.
 Come in.
 This place is a dump!
 I've brought the top scorer, Gon-kun.
 Oh, hey! I've been waiting for you!
 I hear you're Ging's son?
 Why don't you have a seat?
 Uh...
 Where should I sit?
 Isn't there any open space?
 Clear some space, then...
 Like this!
 Uh...
 Wait, where did I put it?
 Oh! Here it is!
 There you go.
 Ruler's Blessing
 Castle awarded to the
 winner of the quiz.
 Comes with capital city
 (population 10,000).
 The city's residents
 will obey any laws or
 commands you give.
 Ruler's Blessing,
 the reward for the top scorer.
 How about it?!
 Isn't it cool?
 Are you amazed? Well?
 There are 10,000 people in this city.
 One of them could be...
 Wait, did I get your hopes up?
 Well?
 Or were you just thinking that
 Ging could be the ruler?
 I was not!
 I never considered that Ging might be here.
 Oh, really now?
 That's good, then...
 Since he's not.
 Dwun-san, can we get to business?
 Oh, my bad.
 Listen up.
 You've collected all one hundred cards.
 Which triggers a new event.
 Hmm...
 Oh, here it is!
 This is it.
 Open it up.
 You can place three restricted
 slot cards in this binder.
 You can then take those three back
 for use in the real world.
 However!
 You cannot take multiple
 copies of the same card.
 You must choose three different restricted
 slot cards from the hundred in your binder.
 Okay, you've reached the ending...
 Do you want the normal ending,
 or the ending just for you?
 Just for me?
 Yep, that's right.
 Which one do you want? Well?
 Then I'll take the normal one.
 Why would you choose that one?
 I didn't clear the game alone, and if it's
 the normal ending, my friends
 can watch with me, right?
 I see...
 Dwun-san?
 Huh?
 Would you stop teasing him?
 I'm sorry...
 There's no such thing as an ending just for you.
 What? Really?
 However, there's a message we've been told
 to give you only after you beat the game.
 Sorry for taking so long to introduce ourselves.
 I'm List.
 He's Dwun.
 As you probably know,
 we're friends of your old man.
 This game was created by Ging
 and ten of his friends.
 The name ""Greed Island"" was created
 from the first letter in each of their names.
 Your father was in charge,
 so we wanted a word that began
 with ""G,"" and settled on ""Greed.""
 Have you met Razor?
 He's the ""R,"" and I'm the ""L.""
 The girl who explains the game at the start
 is the twin of the girl you see
 when leaving the island.
 Eeta and Elena.
 Both names begin with ""E.""
 And then, we have ""D""!
 Wanna hear my story? Well?
 Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
 Y-Yeah...
 Okay, pay attention.
 You see, that Ging...
 was a totally mean guy!
 Totally mean!
 My name is Dwun!
 What do you think is the first letter?
 Huh? Isn't it ""D""?
 Even you, huh?
 Of course you'd think so...
 After all, you're Ging's son.
 Weren't we talking about ""D""?
 It's ""W!"" ""W!""
 W-d-w-u-n-e.
 Wdwune!
 That was my name!
 But even my oldest friends
 thought it began with ""D.""
 So when we decided on the
 game's name, I was clear...
 That my name began with ""W.""
 What do you think Ging said?
 Really?
 Then, ditch the ""W.""
 Starting now, your name is D-w-u-n...
 Dwun.
 Can you believe him?
 He changed my name without asking.
 Just so the title of the game would work!
 What's really amazing
 is that Ging had legally changed
 the name a minute later.
 He only needed a phone and a computer.
 What's worse is that he even removed
 the ""E"" because he got confused!
 But your luck has been better as a result.
 I guess! Ever since...
 Once I've chosen the three cards,
 I'm supposed to go to the port.
 Did they tell you about your father?
 Yeah, but they don't know
 where he is right now.
 Oh...
 So I guess the game didn't have any clues.
 Well, that's what the starting message said.
 Yeah, that's true.
 So, what will you do for the three cards?
 How about we each pick one?
 Blue Planet
 A gemstone with an
 incomparable blue shine.
 Its composition matches
 no known minerals,
 so it's named for its
 otherworldly nature.
 Then I want Blue Planet!
 This is still the best one!
 I can't wait to see the real thing...
 Which one do you want, Killua?
 I'm still thinking.
 Have you decided, Gon?
 Yeah, I think so.
 Really? Which one?
 Let's see...
 This one.
 Which one?
 Wait, why this one?
 I get it.
 That makes sense.
 You're only allowed to take
 restricted slot cards...
 Yep, that sounds fun!
 When did you have the idea?
 The moment I saw this card.
 Paladin's Necklace
 When a player wears this,
 all spells targeting player
 will be reflected.
 Can also dispel curses
 placed on any card
 touched by player.
 But this one won't be enough.
 Right, we also need this one.
 Transform
 Change one card in your possession into any
 other card in your possession. (Card will now
 count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
 and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
 [SR][NORM]
 Eh?
 Do you think this will work?
 Yeah.
 And this is the only way to do it!
 Wait, what is this?
 What are you talking about?
 You're okay with Blue Planet, Bisky?
 Let me in on this!
 Congratulations on clearing the game.
 Please choose three restricted
 slot cards from your binder.
 You've chosen #2, Patch of Shore,
 Patch of Shore
 The entrance to an
 underwater cavern known
 as the Sea God's Grotto.
 The cavern changes
 every time you enter.
 Blue Planet
 A gemstone with an
 incomparable blue shine.
 Its composition matches
 no known minerals,
 so it's named for its
 otherworldly nature.
 #81, Blue Planet,
 Paladin's Necklace
 When a player wears this,
 all spells targeting player
 will be reflected.
 Can also dispel curses
 placed on any card
 touched by player.
 and #84, Paladin's Necklace.
 Are you sure these are the three cards you want?
 Yep.
 Then I will now return your ring.
 Good work.
 Thank you...
 Uh, Elena-san!
 You remembered my name?
 Thank you.
 Goodbye.
 Welcome back!
 Yeah.
 We're back in the real world now?
 I can't tell.
 Well, the game was part of the real world.
 Hey, hurry up!
 Bring out your binder...
 Book.
 Gain!
 This is it!
 This is what I wanted!
 The Blue Planet I've dreamed of for so long!
 I'm so happy!
 What should I name it?
 Pla-chan?
 Maybe Blue-chan?
 Planet-chan?
 Yep, I'll go with Planet-chan!
 So, are you sure about the two you picked?
 Yeah, these are the best ones, right?
 Yep.
 Then let's give it a go!
 Yeah!
 Gain!
 Give it to me, Killua.
 Yes! It worked!
 Okay!
 I see.
 You used Transform to make
 Accompany a restricted slot card,
 then used Paladin's Necklace to revert it.
 That's clever thinking...
 But I'm surprised you'd do
 all that for an Accompany,
 rather than choose a restricted slot card.
 Yeah...
 Well, if I hadn't been the first
 one of us to enter the game,
 I probably wouldn't have noticed.
 Remember when we played
 rock-paper-scissors here?
 Rock-paper-scissors?
 Yeah.
 I was the first to enter the game.
 And while I was waiting for Killua,
 no one else was around.
 Which means the first person I met in the game
 should have been the second
 one to go in, Goreinu-san.
 But when I checked my binder,
 there was someone I met before him.
 Nigg
 Goreinu
 Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.
 Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!
 My guess is that when I was a
 baby, I came here with Ging.
 He was probably trying to tell me this:
 If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,
 I have to get strong enough
 to clear the game...
 Your dedication is really something.
 Well? What will you do once you find Ging?
 Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!
 My best friend in the world!
 Stupid! Cut that out!
 It's embarrassing...
 Really...
 Stop it...
 I can't take this!
 It must be age.
 It doesn't take much to make me cry...
 Hey, wanna come with us to see Ging?
 No, I'll pass.
 I'm not interested in men who already have kids.
 Okay.
 If I stay with you any longer,
 I really will get too attached.
 Well, take care, Bisky.
 Yeah.
 You, too.
 Thank you very much!
 Osu!
 Accompany on!
 Nigg!
 Bye-bye.
 Gon has cleared the game his father created,
 becoming much stronger.
 Is the one waiting before him really Ging?
 G.I. Tutorial
 Coming up, it's the
 Greed Island Tutorial!
 Today, we beat Greed Island.
 We've introduced a whole bunch of cards.
 I did all the introducing!
