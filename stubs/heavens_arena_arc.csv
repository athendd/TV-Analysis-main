 The Heavens Arena.
 Heavens Arena...
 Yeah, I'll explain later.
 We should get moving.
 Okay!
 Whoa.
 Look, it's huge!
 Yep.
 That's Heavens Arena.
 Two hundred and fifty-one stories.
 Nine hundred, ninety-one meters tall.
 The world's fourth tallest building.
 So this is where we'll be training...
 I used up all my money on the trip fare.
 We'll have to make more here.
 After we disembark, we'll start from zero.
 Okay, got it.
 Good... Let's go.
 Yeah!
 Arrival x At The x Arena
 Gon and Killua
 head to Heavens Arena,
 seeking to get stronger.
 Gon.
 There's a really long line.
 Everyone's going to Heavens Arena?
 There aren't any conditions here,
 like there were for the Hunter Exam.
 You just have to defeat your opponent.
 Oh...
 The higher you go, the more
 prize money you earn.
 This is as good as it gets for those looking
 to make a living with their fists.
 Welcome to Heavens Arena.
 Please fill out this form.
 Killua Zoldyck-sama, you are #2054.
 Gon Freecss-sama, you are #2055.
 They'll call your number
 on the first floor of the arena,
 so make sure you remember it.
 Then please go ahead.
 Go!
 Take him out!
 It's been a while,
 but the place hasn't changed.
 Huh? You've been here before?
 Yeah, when I was six.
 My dad left me here without a penny.
 He said I should reach floor 200
 before coming home.
 It took two years.
 Two years...
 Sure, he was only six, but it
 really took Killua that long?
 If you want to fight people of Hisoka's level,
 you'll need to go higher.
 Let's hurry.
 Okay.
 #1973.
 #2055.
 Please enter ring E.
 #2055! That's me!
 I'm getting nervous now.
 Gon, you got through the
 Testing Gate, right?
 Huh?
 In that case...
 Look at that! It's a little boy!
 Hey, kid!
 This is your last chance to run!
 This ain't a game!
 One punch, and he'll fly out of the ring!
 On the first floor, we appraise
 each participant's level.
 You are allowed three minutes
 to demonstrate your prowess.
 Then... Begin!
 Sorry...
 I'll end your suffering with one punch.
 You got through the Testing Gate, right?
 In that case, all you have
 to do is push hard.
 Just push
 hard!
 No way!
 Yes!
 That kid's incredible!
 He's got some crazy power!
 When did I become so strong?
 #2055, proceed to floor 50.
 All right!
 Hey, here's another kid who's a beast!
 Oh?
 You've already been to the 200th floor?
 And this was a strong performance.
 Very well. You may go to the 180th floor...
 Oh, I'll start from the 50th floor.
 Huh?
 I want to take it easy.
 That's enough!
 Yet another strong kid there!
 You are permitted to
 advance to the 50th floor.
 Osu!
 The first 200 floors of Heavens Arena
 are divided into classes,
 each comprised of ten floors.
 So after someone defeats an
 opponent in the 50s,
 they advance to the 60s.
 If they lose, then they'd
 drop back to the 40s.
 Oh, so that's how it works.
 Plus...
 I've heard that
 after you pass the 100th floor,
 you get your own room!
 Oh, I forgot to introduce myself.
 Osu! My name is Zushi!
 What about you guys?
 I'm Killua.
 I'm Gon.
 Nice to meet you.
 We've arrived at the 50th floor.
 I saw your fight earlier.
 That was really amazing!
 What are you talking about?
 You made it up here with one match, too.
 That's right.
 No...
 I still have a long way to go.
 By the way, which martial arts
 discipline do you practice?
 I study the Shingen-ryu fighting technique.
 School? We don't have one, right?
 No...
 What?
 You're that strong with no training?
 I'm kind of shocked...
 I still have so far to go!
 Zushi.
 You did well.
 Master!
 You adhered to my teachings.
 Osu! I am honored!
 Master, your shirt is untucked again.
 Oh, sorry about that...
 Who are they?
 Oh, these are Killua-san and Gon-san.
 Nice to meet you. I'm Wing.
 Osu!
 I didn't expect to meet other children.
 Why are you here?
 Uh...
 Well, we want to become stronger.
 But we're also broke,
 so we're making money simultaneously.
 Killua's a veteran here.
 Oh?
 If you're up here, you must be fairly skilled,
 but you should pay strict attention
 to your opponent's body,
 as well as your own.
 Osu!
 Killua-sama, Gon-sama, and Zushi-sama?
 Please hand me your tickets.
 Here is your prize money.
 One hundred, fifty-two jenny...
 On the 1st floor, win or lose,
 your reward covers a canned drink.
 But beyond that,
 a loss gets you nothing.
 A win over an opponent in the 50s
 nets you fifty thousand.
 Fifty thousand...
 That's a lot.
 In the 100s, I think wins are worth a million.
 What?
 Once you're past the 150th floor,
 you get ten million a pop.
 Ten million?
 Didn't you make it to floor 200
 when you were here before?
 Th-The 200th floor?
 How much do you get for
 winning on the 200th floor?
 Well... I don't really know,
 because I quit once I reached 200.
 But when I was winning in the 190s,
 I had around two hundred million, total.
 T-Two hundred million...
 Where's that money now?
 That was four years ago.
 Of course it's gone now.
 Spent it all on snacks!
 Two hundred million on snacks, in four years?
 What kind of snacks are these?
 Hey, let's head to the waiting room.
 We didn't take any damage in the last fight,
 so they'll probably assign us
 another match today.
 Well, these opponents should be a cinch.
 Just take it easy.
 Really?
 Killua-san!
 You're too loud...
 #2054, Killua-sama.
 I'm already up.
 And #1963, Zushi-sama.
 What?
 Please head to arena A, on the 57th floor.
 Oh.
 Osu! I shall give it my best.
 Sure. Well, you can't win them all.
 Better luck next time.
 I'll head out.
 Yeah. Good luck, guys.
 I'll wait for you above.
 Uh-huh...
 He really didn't have to be so blunt...
 Okay, everyone!
 The event you've all been waiting for!
 We have a unique match-up for you!
 Two young boys, fighting it out!
 However, you don't want to
 underestimate them!
 Both had strong showings
 in their first rounds!
 They both advanced directly to the 50s!
 We will now replay
 their matches on the big screen!
 Killua defeated his opponent in a flash!
 One chop was all it took to knock him out!
 Meanwhile, Zushi used martial arts
 to punish his opponent,
 scoring a flawless knockout
 of a 200-plus kilogram giant!
 Okay, everyone!
 Are you ready to press
 your gamble switches?
 In that case, switch on!
 All bets are in, and the odds favor Zushi!
 Perhaps his martial arts
 knowledge gives him an edge?
 This is bad...
 Killua-san is mad...
 This match will consist of three,
 three-minute rounds,
 decided by the points and knockout system!
 Begin!
 I see.
 His stance leaves few openings.
 He's trained long and hard
 to master that stance.
 But he has no chance against me.
 Wow... Killua is
 boldly walking toward his opponent!
 Sorry.
 But I'm sticking to one chop per
 match until I reach the 150s.
 Clean hit!
 Amazing!
 Killua has knocked out another
 opponent with only a single chop!
 A clean hit and a knockdown
 get him 2 points.
 As you already know, under the
 points and knockout system,
 there are clean hits, critical hits,
 and knockdowns.
 Superb attacks count as ""clean hits,""
 worth one point apiece.
 Unusually superb attacks
 are classified as ""critical hits,""
 worth two points.
 Knocking down your opponent
 earns you one point.
 After amassing ten points, you are
 awarded a technical knockout.
 Of course, if your opponent cannot
 continue to fight after one hit,
 you win due to a knockout!
 That chop ended the fight, stupid.
 Can you fight?
 Yes, I'm okay!
 He got up!
 Zushi will continue!
 Fight!
 Did I hold back too much?
 He's taken another hit!
 Zushi has been knocked down!
 But he's already standing up!
 If you stand before the referee reaches you,
 your opponent isn't awarded the point.
 Tsk. Not bad.
 So the same attack won't
 work twice against you.
 But something's wrong.
 That attack was strong enough that a graze
 should have rendered him unconscious.
 Unbelievable...
 He has dominating power and speed!
 At this rate, I won't stand a chance!
 I have to...
 try it!
 Oh! What's happening?
 Killua has backed away!
 Zushi!
 So, an incredibly loud shout from a spectator
 interrupted the fight,
 but let's get started again!
 Oh, Killua!
 Over here!
 See? I got sixty thousand.
 How about you?
 It took you a while to get here.
 Yeah, I ran into a little trouble.
 Then Zushi was pretty strong.
 No, not at all.
 He has potential.
 One day, he'll be strong.
 But right now,
 he's just target practice for me.
 His punches were weak...
 I was completely able to knock him around.
 But I couldn't defeat him.
 Huh?
 I received the TKO from points,
 but I couldn't knock him out.
 Further...
 When he changed his stance,
 his aura reminded me of my brother's.
 I don't know what it was,
 but it felt dangerous.
 It must be some kind of technique.
 His master
 called it ""Ren.""
 Forgive me, Master!
 I thought I made myself clear, Zushi.
 You were not supposed to use Ren yet.
 Forgive me!
 My opponent was so strong,
 I couldn't help myself...
 Sure. Wanting to win is good.
 But your true goal lies beyond this.
 At this tower's top floor.
 Focus too much on simply winning a fight,
 and you reduce your own potential.
 Osu!
 You must be prepared to lose a
 thousand times while you're here.
 Osu!
 So he isn't supposed
 to use Ren until he reaches the top floor?
 The strongest fighters are at the top, right?
 Gon, change in plans.
 Huh?
 I'm aiming to reach the top floor!
 Uh-huh!
 Actually, that was my goal all along.
 Killua defeats another opponent
 with one chop!
 A knockout!
 Oh! In the other arena,
 Gon has knocked out another opponent
 with a single push!
 Each of them has won six
 consecutive matches
 over the past three days,
 to reach the 100s without a scratch!
 Killua's chop.
 And Gon's push.
 How far will they be able to go?
 And who is going to be able to stop them?
 Yay! A private room!
 We won't have to worry about
 money and lodging anymore.
 I wouldn't be too sure about that.
 If you drop
 below the 100s, you have to
 check out of this room.
 A world of difference separates making it
 to the 100s and staying in the 100s.
 The 100th floor is like a ceiling.
 A ceiling?
 Once you pass it, you get special treatment.
 So everyone focuses on holding their spot.
 Some people will do anything it takes
 to stay in the 100s.
 You can waste a lot of time on them.
 Be careful, Gon.
 Yeah.
 Gon wins another match
 with a single push!
 Guess I didn't need to worry about him.
 Your prize money has been deposited
 into the specified account.
 You were right...
 I've never seen so many zeros before...
 And just a week ago, I was totally broke.
 I'm a little annoyed.
 Huh?
 My first time here,
 it took me two months to reach floor 150.
 Meanwhile, you're breezing through.
 But you were only six back then.
 Well, that's true...
 Oh, that's right.
 I saw Zushi on TV earlier.
 So did I.
 He's still in the 50s.
 I wonder what that Ren you sensed
 could have been.
 Maybe if we fight opponents higher up...
 Or wouldn't it be faster to just ask Zushi?
 Ren is one of the four major principles.
 The four major principles for
 disciplining your mind and body.
 Fundamental to every martial art!
 You must know ""Ten,"" learn ""Zetsu,""
 achieve ""Ren,"" and reach ""Hatsu""!
 This is all part of ""Nen"" training!
 That covers everything!
 I've no idea what you just said!
 Zushi...
 Are you sufficiently educated
 that you can teach others?
 Gon-kun, Killua-kun.
 There's an old saying
 that if you learn something piecemeal,
 you'll end up knowing less
 than when you started.
 So a little knowledge is a dangerous thing?
 But I want to know right now.
 Because it's related to the secret
 behind my brother's power.
 Then, your brother is able to use Nen?
 I need to know what Nen
 and Ren even mean!
 I'll agree to the full learning process
 rather than a quick explanation!
 And if you're willing to teach me,
 I won't try to figure it out myself.
 I understand.
 Come with me to my residence.
 What is Nen? What is Ren?
 Killua believes they are related
 to his brother's abilities.
 Gon wishes to learn what these mean, as well.
 Brush your teeth.

 Nen x And x Nen
 After Killua fought Zushi,
 the young Shingen-ryu practitioner,
 Zushi mentioned the four major principles.
 Gon and Killua are about to learn the secret
 of those principles from Zushi's master, Wing.
 Do I have your attention?
 Nen means to burn your own soul.
 In other words,
 it tests your strength of will.
 Burn
 Nen
 And the four major principles are part
 of a training curriculum for
 strengthening your will.
 Strengthening your will?
 Training?
 That's correct.
 Ten
 Focus
 Ten means to focus your soul to a single point,
 to increase awareness of your ego and goals.
 Express
 Zetsu
 Zetsu means to express yourself in words.
 Temper
 Ren
 Ren means to temper that will.
 Act
 Hatsu
 And Hatsu means to act upon that will.
 Four Major Principles
 Focus
 Express
 Temper
 Act
 Ten.
 Zetsu.
 Ren.
 Hatsu.
 Those are the four major principles.
 Killua-kun, Zushi tempered his ""refusal
 to lose,"" during his fight with you.
 So, allow me to demonstrate.
 Killua-kun...
 I think I'm going to kill you now.
 Are you ready?
 Yeah, sure.
 It's not happening.
 Then I'll take this step-by-step.
 First comes Ten.
 I focus my soul into a single point.
 Zetsu.
 You can express yourself mentally or verbally.
 I will kill you.
 That was Ren.
 If I temper my will enough,
 then I can act. Hatsu.
 If your will is strong enough,
 you can make your opponent back down,
 without moving a muscle.
 The concept of bluffing derives from this.
 Ren hardens that which is soft,
 and you lose the ability to
 correct an incorrect idea.
 Therefore, you should avoid using Ren
 until your soul has fully matured.
 Right now, you boys and Zushi
 should be training your souls.
 Let's go, Gon.
 If you wish to learn about Nen,
 you should focus on mastering Ten.
 If you master Ten,
 you will no longer feel the pressure
 of an opponent's will.
 Thank you very much!
 Wait up, Killua!
 Zushi.
 Yes, sir.
 Let's begin training.
 O-Osu!
 First...
 He was lying?
 Yeah. The explanation made perfect sense,
 and Wing is clearly very strong.
 But his story had holes.
 Huh?
 Zushi's toughness.
 He kept getting up after
 I knocked him down.
 I was getting irritated,
 so I used all of my strength
 during my last attack.
 Brat!
 Crap!
 He flew out of the ring!
 Even an amateur can see that
 he's headed for the hospital!
 Oh! He stood back up.
 Zushi must be invincible.
 Impossible.
 However, the referee has awarded
 a critical hit and knockdown.
 Killua wins by TKO, with eleven total points.
 Willpower didn't keep him standing.
 He's hiding some other secret.
 What's wrong, Zushi?
 Your Ten is unstable.
 Master...
 Hmm?
 Why did you lie to them?
 Lie?
 You mean my explanation?
 Yes!
 The four major principles are
 Ten, Zetsu, Ren, and Hatsu.
 But they don't mean what you said.
 Did you lie because they aren't your students?
 I didn't lie.
 Nen is an important method
 for training your soul.
 Force
 However, it's true that I can't teach Nen
 to someone who is not a student.
 So I used the other Nen as a hint,
 to help them along.
 If Nen is used the wrong way,
 it can become a terrible weapon.
 For example...
 You could turn a piece of paper
 into a blade to harm others,
 while hardening your body,
 as a defensive measure.
 With enough work, anyone can use Nen.
 That is why
 you must be careful when
 deciding to teach it.
 Master...
 I didn't
 have a chance to read that book yet...
 And that can of juice was mine...
 S-Sorry...
 It's time for the day's biggest match!
 The rookies Killua and Gon have advanced
 to the 190th floor without dropping a fight.
 Will they be able to keep moving on?
 Okay, everyone...
 Get ready to press your gamble switches!
 Unfortunately, your shove won't work on me.
 That's because
 I am as slippery as a snake,
 with sharp fangs,
 to bite at your vital points.
 You may sport a vicious chop,
 but you can't overcome these muscles!
 That's because...
 I'm totally ripped!
 Begin!
 Critical hit and knockdown...
 Three points.
 Knockout!
 The winner is Gon!
 Critical hit and knockdown...
 Three points.
 Knockout!
 The winner is Killua!
 Once again, Gon and Killua have knocked
 out their opponents with one attack.
 And both of them have
 successfully cleared the 190s!
 Both have advanced to the 200s!
 They've already reached the 200s?!
 Zushi.
 Master!
 Killua-kun and Gon-kun have
 already reached the 200s?
 Yes, they're amazing!
 I need to train more...
 Huh?
 Master?
 I have no choice.
 Enjoy.
 What's the 200th floor like?
 Beats me.
 I've never been up here before.
 Wow!
 The 200th floor is so fancy!
 Where's the receptionist?
 This way?
 We finally made it.
 Yeah.
 What is this?
 All of a sudden, it feels like
 we're in a monster-filled jungle.
 But this is an ordinary hallway.
 Let's go.
 We can do this!
 This isn't working...
 I can't move forward!
 I don't want to move forward...
 This is murderous intent,
 aimed at us.
 Hey! Who's there?
 Show yourself!
 Killua-sama and Gon-sama, correct?
 The receptionist's desk is over here,
 so please register for a 200s match today.
 You won't be able to register
 after midnight, so please be careful.
 Was she the source of all that?
 I can't tell.
 By the way, there are currently
 one hundred, seventy-three
 contestants in the 200s class.
 And starting from the 200s,
 all weapons are allowed in matches.
 So please use whatever you have.
 Also, you will no longer receive
 prize money in the 200s class.
 You will fight only for glory,
 so please understand that
 if you're going to participate.
 Huh?!
 H-Hisoka...
 Why are you here?
 It's hardly that strange.
 I love to fight,
 and this is a temple to fighting.
 And why are you here?
 Just kidding...
 This was no coincidence.
 I've been waiting for you.
 Remember how you ordered airship
 tickets over the cybernet?
 With a little effort,
 it's possible to determine where
 and when someone will arrive.
 Well,
 I knew you would come here eventually.
 And so,
 as a veteran, I have a warning for you.
 It's still too early for you boys
 to step on this floor.
 How early depends on your efforts.
 Leave for now.
 It's too early right now.
 That's stupid!
 We just got up here...
 I won't let you pass.
 Not that you could, anyway.
 Wh-What is...
 ...this?
 Don't be reckless!
 Wing-san!
 You have no defense
 against his Nen.
 Nen?
 Right now, you are like someone standing
 naked in a blizzard, wondering why it is cold.
 If you continue to strain
 your body, you may die.
 This is Nen?!
 He can stop us from moving
 forward through willpower?
 Don't lie!
 Yes, I was lying.
 Though technically, I wasn't lying completely.
 I will teach you the truth about Nen.
 So retreat for now.
 Hey, receptionist lady.
 Oh, yes?
 What happens if we don't register
 for a fight today?
 Gon-sama, you would have to
 start again, from the first floor.
 However, Killua-sama
 refused to register once before.
 So if he fails to register again,
 his commitment will be questioned,
 and he will be banned from participating.
 Hey, Wing-san.
 If we back down now,
 will we be able to return here
 by midnight?
 That depends on you.
 Simply put,
 this is Nen.
 Nen refers to the ability
 to manipulate your aura,
 Force
 Nen
 also known as life energy.
 Every person possesses a
 small amount of life energy.
 But in most cases, it's simply discharged.
 The ability to build up
 a shroud of life energy is known as Ten.
 Shroud
 You can make your body harder,
 Shroud
 Ten
 and considerably slow the effects of aging.
 Then comes Zetsu.
 Null
 Zetsu
 As you may guess, this nullifies your aura.
 It is effective for
 concealing your presence,
 and recovering from extreme fatigue.
 Which brings us to Ren.
 Enhance
 Ren
 A technique to create an especially strong aura.
 Can you feel that?
 Yeah, I can feel the pressure.
 But it doesn't feel dangerous.
 That's because I have no hostile intent.
 However, I must admit I am
 impressed by their senses.
 Perhaps it's because of
 how they've grown up.
 But their natural potential is
 also a major factor.
 Aura is an energy that comes
 from within humans.
 Which makes it very effective
 against other humans.
 For better or worse.
 If you attack a helpless person, with ill intent,
 you can use aura to kill.
 Only one thing can protect you
 from someone who uses Nen.
 You must also learn to use Nen.
 You must use Ten for defense.
 Block the other person's aura with your own.
 Otherwise...
 Your body will be crushed.
 Hisoka blocks the path leading
 beyond the 200th floor.
 Will Gon and Killua be able
 to learn enough about
 true Nen to pass Hisoka,
 and reach the receptionist,
 before the clock strikes midnight?
 It's too early.

 Awakening x And x Potential
 As the hour grows late,
 Wing's lecture has reached its climax.
 But they only have until midnight.
 Before that time,
 Gon and Killua must learn Nen.
 Nen is a power that dwells
 within every person.
 However, at present,
 only a few are capable of using that power.
 Thus, they are treated as
 geniuses, leaders, psychics,
 mystics, or superhumans.
 A power that dwells within everyone...
 Yes.
 And there are two means
 by which to awaken this power.
 The deliberate way and the aggressive way.
 Zushi underwent the deliberate method.
 He was a quick learner, and he trained hard.
 So he was able to master Ten
 in a very short time.
 In about six months.
 That's too long...
 We need to learn Ten,
 and pass Hisoka's Nen barrier before midnight!
 Then you'll have to try the aggressive method.
 Will it be fast enough?
 That will depend on you.
 Can you learn to hold your aura within
 your body, before time runs out?
 That is the key.
 I will now direct my aura toward you.
 This is known as Hatsu,
 which I demonstrated earlier.
 Naturally, I will restrain myself,
 since my objective is not
 to destroy your bodies.
 However, this way is still perilous.
 In other words, I will attempt
 to shock you into awakening.
 I will give your sleeping body a jolt,
 so you can learn Ten more easily.
 I say that your body sleeps because
 your body's openings,
 or micropyles, are closed,
 meaning that your aura flow is stunted.
 Therefore,
 I will send my aura into your bodies,
 to open your micropyles.
 [Micropyles]
 Numerous pores in the body,
 which release aura.
 Under normal circumstances,
 you would spend a long time
 meditating and discovering your own auras,
 while slowly opening those apertures.
 Even Zushi, a natural talent,
 required three months.
 However, you two could do it in a week.
 Or even sooner.
 Which is why I find it unfortunate
 that we have such little time to work with.
 I don't really get it...
 But quick and dirty is always better.
 This is a shady, highly frowned upon method.
 You will be ignoring the correct procedure.
 You could even die,
 if the person using this method
 were weak or evil.
 But you aren't weak, and you aren't evil.
 Right?
 That's why I want to know...
 Shroud   Force
 Null

 Why would you
 suddenly decide to teach us the
 true four major principles?
 Because I did not want to
 squander this opportunity.
 If you were to challenge the 200s,
 with none of this knowledge,
 you would suffer greatly.
 Up there, everyone knows
 how to manipulate Nen.
 And they have a special
 greeting for any newcomer
 ignorant of Nen,
 a Nen attack.
 In other words, they do what I am about to,
 but without restraint.
 They don't care, even if people die...
 Only those who survive
 are allowed to pass.
 They are the chosen.
 However, they pay a steep price.
 That's why I wanted you to be prepared.
 Now, despite my attempts to scare you,
 I have confidence that this
 will awaken your power!
 You have the potential.
 As well as the ability.
 Put your belongings down,
 take off your shirt,
 and turn your backs toward me.
 It's so hot!
 And I can feel pressure, even though
 Wing-san isn't touching me.
 This is it! That sensation...
 Like something invisible and slimy,
 crawling across my skin.
 Amplify this by millions of times,
 and it'd feel like my brother's Nen ?
 I'll begin.
 Every micropyle on your bodies has opened.
 Th-This is...
 That is your aura, or life energy.
 You can see it now,
 because the micropyles in your
 eyes were also opened.
 It's like smoke.
 Like steam, rising from the spout of a kettle.
 It's rushing out from every part of my body.
 It won't stop gushing out.
 Isn't that dangerous?
 This is your life energy,
 so if it continues to escape,
 you will grow tired.
 If you expend all your aura,
 you will collapse from fatigue.
 Really?
 Listen to me.
 You must concentrate on keeping
 your aura within your body.
 Close your eyes!
 Use any stance that helps you to focus.
 Then visualize your aura flowing
 like blood through your body.
 From the top of your head,
 to your right shoulder.
 To your hand, before passing through
 your legs, to the left side.
 And now visualize that flow
 beginning to ebb
 and hovering around your body.
 These boys are incredible.
 I didn't need to tell them that a natural stance
 would be the most effective.
 With minimal advice, they've already
 mastered the technique.
 Magnificent...
 And terrifying.
 Slowly open your eyes.
 How do you feel?
 I feel like I'm surrounded by some
 kind of warm mucus.
 Yeah, like I'm wearing weightless clothes.
 Continue to maintain those images.
 Once you've assimilated them,
 you'll be able to use Ten while asleep.
 Next, I will use hostile Nen against you!
 Previously, it would have
 been painful for you to stand within this.
 Yeah,
 I understand your blizzard analogy now.
 If you can fend off my Nen,
 you'll be able to break through his barrier!
 Here I come!
 Welcome to the 200s.
 It appears that I needn't bother
 with the traditional greeting.
 I can guess why you've come
 to Heavens Arena.
 You intended to train before challenging me...
 Yeah, but I didn't expect to find you here.
 That saves me time.
 You should avoid being overconfident
 in your ability to use Ten.
 There is much to learn about Nen.
 To be honest,
 at present, I feel no urge to fight you.
 However...
 If you manage to win a single
 match in the 200s,
 I shall accept your challenge.
 Let's go.
 Yeah.
 Newcomers?
 Looks like it.
 Seems that they can use it.
 Indeed...
 Welcome to the 200s!
 Please fill out the forms here.
 Would you like to register for a match now?
 In this class, there is a self-service system
 by which you're permitted
 ninety days of preparation.
 You may choose to fight on
 any day during that time.
 Of course, you're free to fight every day,
 and you can also wait until
 the very last day to fight.
 Once you've participated in a fight,
 you have another ninety days to prepare.
 However, if you don't fight before
 those ninety days end,
 you will be disqualified,
 and your name will be struck from all records.
 Does that mean we'll be fighting
 in this class multiple times?
 Yes,
 you need ten wins to clear this floor.
 However, if you lose four times before ten wins,
 you'll be disqualified.
 And
 if you win ten times,
 you have a chance to challenge
 the Floor Masters!
 The Floor Masters are the twenty-one
 strongest fighters here.
 Each claims one of the floors,
 from 230 to 250.
 Do you understand now?
 If you defeat a Floor Master,
 you become the new master of that floor!
 Th-That's not all!
 If you become a Floor Master,
 you earn the right to participate in
 the biennial celebration of
 combat, Battle Olympia!
 No reaction?
 Forget that.
 Is there anything special about the top floor?
 That's what you want to know?!
 The champion of Battle Olympia
 gets to live on the top floor!
 It's an incredible honor.
 A penthouse 1,000 meters above the ground...
 Don't you get it?!
 But Killua's house is 3,700 meters
 above ground, right?
 A-And the champion always
 receives a prize of...
 What do you wanna do, Gon?
 Now that I know the top floor's secret,
 I don't care anymore.
 Yeah! I just want to fight with Hisoka.
 Why are you kids even here?
 Well, then you'll need to win a fight.
 But you're gonna wait a bit first, right?
 No...
 I'm doing this!
 I have to find out how different
 these opponents are.
 I'll need you to fill out this form, as well.
 Okay!
 You want something?
 No, not really.
 We're simply in line to register for a fight.
 Oh, I get it.
 Gon, these guys want to fight
 on the day you do.
 I'm ready to go whenever.
 There you go.
 This boy has plenty of spunk.
 Then Gon-sama will be in room 2207.
 Killua-sama will be in room 2223.
 We will let you know which day your match is.
 Thanks!
 They must have gone through
 that greeting Four-Eyes mentioned.
 If we'd gone in blind,
 we could've ended up like them.
 Wow! This room is huge!
 Hey, are you listening to me?
 The bath is squeaky clean.
 Whee... I've never seen such a big bed!
 Look, Killua...
 Hey, Gon!
 Your battle has been set
 for 3 PM, March 11th!!
 What? Tomorrow?!
 That's fast.
 I probably won't be able to win tomorrow.
 But that's okay.
 I need the experience.
 I need to discover what I
 can do with this power.
 Okay, we have a thrilling match for you today.
 First, we have Gon, who managed
 to zip straight to this class!
 His opponent will be Gido,
 who currently holds a respectable 4-1 record.
 Listen to me, Gon-kun. Killua-kun.
 Ten is a purely defensive technique.
 You have not improved
 your offensive capabilities.
 Plus, you will still take damage
 from physical attacks.
 A highly skilled Nen opponent
 will be able to penetrate your Ten,
 and deal a lethal blow.
 So you should wait two months
 before you start fighting.
 During that time, I will
 teach you as much as I can.
 Sorry, Wing-san.
 But I'm itching to fight right now!
 Good grief.
 That boy is a real handful...
 And...
 Begin!
 Dancing Tops
 There they are, Gido's Dancing Tops!
 He uses numerous tops to
 attack his opponent!
 Here we go...
 Battle Waltz!
 Clean hit!
 Oh, Gon gives up a clean hit
 and one point, right off the bat!
 He's off to a rough start.
 Damn!
 I can use Nen
 to keep these tops spinning
 for hours, as my attack.
 The attack pattern is so complex,
 even I don't know what will come next!
 Tops spinning into each other
 and attacking me...
 That small top deals damage
 equivalent to a hammer!
 Gon has begun his first battle of the
 200s class, which is filled with Nen users.
 The 200s class is nothing like he expected.
 Can Gon survive this predicament?
 Or not?

 Fierce x And x Ferocious
 Gon is in his first 200s match,
 but he's been caught off guard
 by the unexpected nature
 of his opponent's attack.
 He's been hit from behind by another top!
 Gon is in big trouble,
 after having been surrounded by Dancing Tops!
 Clean hit and knockdown!
 Two points!
 Gido has already earned four points!
 Can you continue?
 You bet!
 There are too many tops for me to track.
 Damn...
 What should I do?
 M-Master...
 Is he using Nen?
 Yes, that is a form of Hatsu.
 He's projecting his aura into the tops.
 That allows the tops
 to move with more strength and
 speed than normally possible.
 Manipulating a small object requires
 only a small amount of aura.
 A large object requires a
 larger amount of aura.
 Gido is also using Nen in other ways here.
 Those tops couldn't be so strong
 were he simply using his aura to spin them.
 It can only be accomplished
 because he cares deeply about his tops.
 Objects respond well
 to those who are compatible.
 I can't follow them with my eyes.
 Nen is powering the tops!
 I can sense it.
 Yeah, I can sense them.
 My Ten is fading!
 Another direct hit!
 Gon is completely helpless!
 He's been knocked out of the ring!
 The score is now 6-0!
 He's dug himself a big hole!
 It won't work...
 If I focus on sensing the tops,
 my Ten shroud will dissolve.
 What should I do?
 A top was knocked outside the ring?
 But it isn't attacking me...
 What's wrong? Can you continue fighting?
 Be quiet! I'm thinking right now.
 If you're not in the ring within a ten-count,
 I'll rule you the loser!
 One!
 Now that I think about it,
 the Nen in this top didn't feel hostile.
 What about the others?
 They're spinning around,
 bumping into each other.
 Maybe the tops aren't actually targeting me?
 Four!
 Why are you standing outside the ring?
 If I stay in the ring, I'll get hurt!
 Five!
 Just as I thought...
 This is like a game of sumo tops!
 It's impossible to command tops
 to move with precision.
 It's likely Gido simply commands the tops
 to strike anything in their way.
 They spin around, striking whatever
 happens to cross their paths.
 Seven!
 In that case, I don't need to fear the tops.
 I can ignore the tops, and attack him!
 Heh, you may have figured out my tops,
 but you still can't land an attack!
 There it is!
 Gido's special technique,
 combining offense and defense!
 Tornado Top!
 Tornado Top
 He lands a strong counter on Gon!
 Three points!
 The judge has awarded a
 critical hit and knockdown!
 Gido has nine points!
 Gon is on the verge of losing!
 I turn myself into a top to protect myself,
 while using my Dancing Tops to attack.
 My strategy might be boring,
 but it's effective for racking up points.
 There are a number of ways to defeat Gido.
 You can attack him until
 he tires, and his Ten begins to fade.
 You can use Hatsu that overpowers his defense.
 Both methods require a large amount of aura.
 However, Gon-kun doesn't know Ren,
 the technique to instantly generate aura.
 Learning how to quickly
 create large amounts of aura,
 and how to channel it into attacks,
 requires endless training and
 combat experience to learn.
 He'd need five more years
 before he could fight Gido.
 I'm sure he's beginning to realize that now.
 What should I do?
 What will it take to prolong this match?
 If he scores one more point, it's over.
 But I want to keep fighting.
 What can I do right now?
 That would be...
 Gon!
 He released his Ten?
 That's reckless!
 But he didn't simply release it.
 That's...
 Zetsu...
 The technique for concealing your presence!
 Your aura also disappears because
 your micropyles are sealed.
 Any aura that normally escapes
 your body is also nullified,
 so he has no Nen protection!
 I didn't teach him Zetsu use!
 Did he learn it on his own, before we met?
 In that case, he wouldn't realize
 that this is Zetsu.
 He must have learned it while
 attempting to track a beast or other target...
 The boy certainly has incredible potential.
 But why would he use it now,
 in this situation?
 Idiot!
 If you're hit by a Nen attack, without protection,
 you'll be totally messed up!
 I know that.
 But in order to track the tops' complex
 pathing with only sensations to go on,
 I must focus all my senses...
 Could it be that
 he never expected to win?
 He's risking his life...
 Risking his life to train?
 You don't want to live, kid?
 Then I'll help you die!
 What?!
 Amazing!
 It's the first time Gon has managed
 to evade an attack!
 I can feel them...
 I know where they're heading!
 This is all I can do right now...
 Concentrate on dodging
 my opponent's attacks!
 I can still fight!
 Your right radius and ulna were both broken.
 Fractured humerus.

 You moron!
 Sorry.
 An apology won't help!
 Do you have any brains in there?
 Didn't you see what happened
 to those who'd suffered
 the traditional Nen greeting?
 One wrong move, and you could
 have ended up like them!
 You're lucky not to be
 hurt any worse.
 Man, why do you think
 Four-Eyes was training us?
 Still...
 I had a feeling I'd be okay.
 I took a few hits,
 but I wasn't in mortal danger, as long
 as he missed my vital spots...
 Come in.
 Four-Eyes!
 Uh, sorry...
 An apology won't help!
 What were you thinking?!
 Didn't you see those who'd suffered
 the traditional Nen greeting?
 You could have ended up just like them!
 Oh, that's what I just told him.
 Honestly...
 I'm glad you weren't injured any worse.
 Wing-san, I really am sorry.
 No, I won't let this one slide.
 Killua-kun,
 do you know when Gon-kun will
 have recovered completely?
 The doctor said it would take two months.
 I understand.
 Thank you, Killua.
 In that case,
 I won't allow you to participate in
 any matches for two months!
 I won't allow you to train in,
 or study about, Nen.
 If you don't abide by these rules,
 I will never teach you again.
 Well?
 I understand. I'll do as you say.
 Give me your left hand.
 This is a promise thread.
 It will be a visual reminder of your promise.
 Killua-kun, a moment, please.
 Killua-kun,
 what is the true objective
 you two are pursuing?
 Well, we don't really have an objective.
 Before running into Zushi and you,
 my plan was to earn some quick cash.
 Gon's here to train hard,
 so he can defeat a guy named Hisoka.
 That's it, really.
 Looks like the others in the 200s
 want to reach the top floor.
 Battle Olympia, was it?
 I'm not too interested.
 Oh, Gon is...
 Well, I'm not sure...
 He said that he only wants to fight Hisoka.
 But after seeing his match yesterday,
 I have a feeling he enjoys the thrills...
 How long will this exchange continue?
 There are nearly fifty tops flying
 around the ring!
 Gon is evading the frightening
 whirlwind of tops!
 Gido has used up all of his tops,
 and can only watch with the rest of us!
 Not that way!
 There's nowhere to run...
 You say that he was enjoying a situation
 that could have cost him his life?
 Yeah.
 I know because I've felt the same way.
 Although I take circumstances
 into consideration, too.
 Once he's in the zone,
 he loses sight of everything else.
 Oh!
 But he isn't the type to break a
 promise twice, so you needn't worry.
 Perhaps I have...
 It's too late.
 Because Gon and I already know.
 If you regret teaching us
 and decide to back out,
 we'll find someone else,
 or we'll learn it ourselves.
 You don't have to feel responsible.
 My brother and Hisoka can both use Nen,
 so Gon and I were bound to
 discover it eventually.
 I understand.
 And I mean to finish what I started.
 There are many things I must tell you.
 Zushi is waiting in my lodge.
 You can train with him.
 No, I'll pass.
 Huh?
 I won't leave Gon behind.
 If he keeps his promise,
 I'll start training when he does.
 Tell Gon-kun this...
 I will allow him to practice the other ""Nen""!
 Tell him to practice ""Ten"" daily!
 Hey, Gon.
 Master...
 I may have
 awakened an incredible beast...
 Master?
 What do you mean?
 You found the agency on your own,
 so you must be sharp.
 But I can't recommend you to
 one of our valued clients.
 I have no problem with your lack of experience.
 Some clients don't mind greenhorns.
 But it isn't experience alone that you lack.
 What do you mean?
 I said that I have a Hunter License!
 But your exam hasn't ended yet.
 I can tell.
 What?
 Can you see anything?
 Eh?
 Next to me.
 You can't see a thing, right?
 Once you've learned to see,
 return.
 That's the bare minimum.
 What does she mean?
 What is it that I cannot see?
 You can't see it, but you can sense it.
 Why did you do that?!
 This?
 Well, I was just playing with you.
 Fate had a hand in crossing our paths.
 Consider this advice from a veteran...
 You didn't notice when I stole this,
 and you didn't notice when I walked past you.
 Bastard... Return my Hunter License!
 Can a newbie who knows nothing
 of Nen defeat me?
 Nen?
 Wanna give it a try?
 Understand now?
 You still lack something.
 I...
 I need...
 Enough power to fight on my own!
 Come with me.
 I'll be your teacher.
 The real exam has only just begun.
 Gon's hidden potential begins to awaken.
 And Kurapika has also encountered
 a new power that will help propel him forward.

 One month has passed
 since Gon was badly injured
 in his match with Gido.
 In Heavens Arena,
 all eyes are focused on a
 certain upcoming match.
 Gon, I got something good...
 Oh, Killua,
 I was about to go looking for you.
 Uh...
 Are you really healed?
 Yeah!
 See? I'm perfectly fine!
 Okay, I get it.
 Those injuries should've kept him
 out of action for four months,
 but he recovered in a month.
 Man, what is your body made of?
 How to answer that...
 You're weird.
 Well?
 Weren't you about to say something?
 Oh, here.
 Tickets?
 These aren't just tickets.
 They're for Hisoka's fight.
 As a 200s fighter, I got dibs on tickets.
 The tickets to Hisoka's match
 are a really hot item.
 There are even scalpers hawking them.
 Oh...
 So I've been gathering information.
 It turns out that Hisoka's the real deal.
 He has an 8-3 record, with 6 KO's.
 Each KO has led to death.
 But he's lost three matches...
 His three losses were due to forfeits.
 Forfeits?
 He reached the registration deadline,
 so he signed up for a fight, but didn't show.
 Which means...
 If Hisoka actually fights, he doesn't lose.
 Yeah.
 And he's only given up a total of four points.
 One knockdown, three clean hits.
 He's as strong as a Floor Master.
 I'm in trouble...
 Jeez.
 You don't look like someone who
 thinks they're in trouble.
 So, his opponent is some guy named Kastro.
 Two years ago, he claimed the sole
 knockdown against Hisoka.
 And of the four points scored against Hisoka,
 he's responsible for three.
 He scored three points against Hisoka...
 You could say they have a history.
 Apparently, they both registered for the
 same day so they could fight each other.
 You should have the chance to
 analyze Hisoka's fighting style.
 Maybe we'll get to see Hisoka go all-out.
 But is this okay?
 I promised Wing-san...
 I won't allow you to participate in
 any matches for two months!
 I won't allow you to train in,
 or study about, Nen.
 Of course it's okay!
 You'll just be watching a match.
 It is not okay!
 Viewing a match counts as learning about Nen.
 W-Wing-san...
 Don't scare us.
 Gon-kun,
 has your arm healed?
 Y-Yes! It's fine now.
 He has unbelievable regenerative powers.
 Since he's recovered, he can
 watch the match, right?
 No, I told Gon-kun to wait two months.
 Gon-kun, you should spend one more month
 practicing ""Ten,"" and recovering
 from your injuries.
 Oh...
 Okay, I understand.
 Well,
 then it's fine.
 Osu! Take care.
 Oh, well...
 You'll have to watch a recording,
 so I'll go and see it in person.
 He's kept his promise.
 He's only practiced ""Ten"" each day.
 I can tell from the faint aura that surrounds him
 under normal circumstances.
 Their auras flow like serene rivers.
 Master?
 Hmm?
 Oh, never mind...
 It's nothing.
 This won't do...
 I'm the one who's losing control.
 Hello! I'm your announcer, Cocco!
 Today in Heavens Arena,
 we have Kastro versus Hisoka,
 the match you've all been waiting for!
 Just look at this crowd!
 The match doesn't start for another hour,
 but the arena is already packed!
 This is a promise thread.
 It will be a visual reminder of your promise.
 Two years ago, Hisoka was
 the winner of their match.
 The audience is fired up to
 watch this match of destiny,
 as Kastro looks for revenge!
 Sporting an 8-3 record, with all three losses
 being forfeits due to absence,
 we have the deadly magician with the
 tendency toward absence, Hisoka!
 And opposing him, boasting a 9-1 record,
 one win away from the Floor Masters after
 nine straight wins since his loss to Hisoka,
 we have the martial artist, Kastro!
 Will he avenge his earlier loss,
 as he's predicted?
 Get ready for a battle between the two fighters
 nearest to reaching the Floor Masters!
 Oh? I expected some kind of macho gorilla...
 Next up, we have an interview with
 Kastro, from a few days ago.
 I wouldn't fight if I didn't expect to win.
 You'll see that I'm not the same
 person I was two years ago.
 Oh, he sounds confident...
 We'll see if he can back it up.
 Wh-What?
 There he is.
 Was there something you needed?
 What?
 R-Ridiculous.
 He was just sitting on the couch...
 When did he move?
 Did he open the door and slip behind me,
 without catching my attention?
 No, that's impossible!
 I never took my eyes off the door
 until after he spoke.
 He never had the chance.
 How did he do this?
 W-Well, I was hoping for an autograph.
 From me?
 You honor me,
 Killua-kun.
 I keep tabs on all my rivals in the 200s class.
 You're not with Gon?
 Oh, so you do know everything.
 Are you here to scout an opponent?
 Nope,
 I just wanted a closer look.
 And what do you think?
 You're pretty damn good.
 Thank you.
 Your Zetsu was quite impressive.
 However, you should have
 concealed your presence
 before reaching this floor.
 When an aura as strong as yours disappears,
 that would put most of us on alert.
 You've been following up on me
 since I reached this floor?
 Pretty much.
 Then I want to know...
 How did you do that just now?
 Unfortunately, I can't tell you.
 After all, I might have to fight you someday.
 Don't worry.
 I'm not interested in fighting here again.
 Really?
 That isn't what your aura says.
 That was a joke.
 I'll answer your question when we fight.
 I'll wait for you in Battle Olympia.
 I'm sure you can get there.
 I told you I'm not interested in fighting!
 Yes, it's finally time...
 The long-awaited rematch between
 Hisoka and Kastro!
 I'm very grateful, Hisoka.
 If not for the initiation you gave me back then,
 I'd never have become this strong.
 You mean to imply that you're stronger now?
 Just so you're aware,
 I never used my full strength
 in any of the nine matches after my loss to you.
 Those matches were nothing more
 than a warm-up for my defeat of you.
 Begin!
 Here I come!
 A clean hit!
 Kastro has landed the first strike!
 What was that?
 Give me your best shot, Hisoka.
 Kastro is the one to land the first strike!
 Hisoka has surrendered the first point,
 after failing to evade Kastro's swift chop!
 Again... An illusion?
 I'm not the same person I was two years ago.
 I won't hold back on my next attack.
 You'll have my best shot when
 I deem it necessary.
 Very well.
 Then I hope you'll change your mind soon.
 Again...
 I was sure he dodged that!
 What's wrong?
 Will you just run around, rather than attack?
 Clean hit! And knockdown!
 What an amazing start!
 Kastro has been knocking his opponent around!
 The score is now 4-0.
 However, are my eyes deceiving me?
 Have you still not changed your mind?
 Would you prefer to die ignorant?
 C-Can you fight?
 If I am not mistaken,
 you seemed to disappear...
 That's right!
 He disappeared!
 That's what I saw!
 No,
 that is not an accurate description.
 You were readying a kick from the front,
 when suddenly, you were behind me.
 I suppose that would be more precise.
 But that doesn't sound right...
 Something is off.
 Yes,
 I feel I'm missing something very basic here...
 It's futile.
 If you continue to run in circles,
 you'll never learn the truth.
 Because I'm done waiting.
 I'll take your arm with my next strike.
 If you still will not attack,
 then so be it.
 It seems you weren't good enough.
 Tiger Bite Fist
 He's going to use his Tiger Bite Fist!
 Kastro's getting serious!
 Tiger Bite Fist?
 That technique
 can split a tree in two, when used by a master.
 Meanwhile, Hisoka still hasn't
 figured out Kastro's ability.
 Well, I don't really understand it, either.
 At this rate, Hisoka's gonna die!
 Here I come!
 Go ahead and take it.
 Not worried, huh?
 Or is this meant to be a trap?
 Either way,
 I'll take your arm!
 Your other one.
 Hisoka's arm!
 Hisoka's right arm has been severed!
 You shouldn't assume that
 I'll act the way you want.
 This was just part of the plan.
 What crap.
 Have we ever seen Hisoka in
 such a perilous situation?
 He's taken considerable damage!
 I understand.
 Your ability is, in fact,
 a double.
 Impressive.
 You are correct.
 A double?
 What does he mean?
 Then it wasn't an illusion!
 When Kastro attacked,
 there really were two of him.
 What is going on here?
 Kastro has split into two?
 Cloned himself?
 Instead of disappearing, he's multiplying!
 Does he actually have a twin?!
 Is this your doppelganger?
 Indeed.
 Doppelganger?
 Yes.
 Master, what does that mean?
 It refers to a double, as in an additional you.
 When you spot someone who resembles you,
 that's called a doppelganger.
 Er, I don't get it...
 When you encounter a doppelganger,
 you experience headaches and fatigue,
 which continue until your double is destroyed.
 Some believe that the double
 takes energy from the original.
 B-But Kastro-san isn't suffering at all.
 He's really strong.
 That's only a story.
 Besides, he mastered this
 ability through training.
 I listened to your warning,
 and I watched carefully, rather than run.
 And it turns out my deduction that
 you disappeared was correct.
 So why did I question that description?
 That's because
 I still sensed your presence beside me.
 In fact, right before you disappeared,
 I felt a new presence.
 You duplicate yourself before disappearing.
 I'm impressed that you managed to figure that out.
 I was able to successfully create a double with Nen.
 My double goes on the attack,
 while I hide in the shadows.
 As soon as you react,
 I dismiss my double, and attack.
 So those fluttering clothes were
 meant to help him hide.
 The most skilled Nen user would still experience
 difficulty in figuring out
 this trick, while in combat.
 Naturally,
 my double is no mere illusion.
 It exists as a second me until I send it away.
 You know this after suffering
 an attack from my double.
 In other words, you must fight both of my selves.
 This is the true Tiger Bite Fist,
 completed through the mastery of Nen.
 I call it the True Tiger Bite Fist!
 True Tiger Bite Fist
 Incredible! We have an
 upset in the making!
 Hisoka, the winner two years ago,
 is in deep trouble!
 Will Kastro be able to avenge
 his previous defeat?
 Next, I will take your left arm.
 Will you continue to act disinterested?
 Hmm, let's see...
 I think I have a little motivation now.
 The fearsome double-user, Kastro,
 and the magician, Hisoka.
 Their incredible battle will have
 an unthinkable end,
 but Gon knows nothing of all this yet.

 A x Surprising x Win
 Kastro has used Nen to create
 a double of himself.
 And his special attack, the True Tiger Bite Fist,
 has severed Hisoka's right arm.
 Who will emerge victorious?
 What's this?
 Hisoka has covered his right arm with a scarf?
 Shall I demonstrate my powers of clairvoyance?
 Wow!
 His right arm has disappeared,
 and cards rain down!
 What does he intend to do?!
 Now, then...
 I have cards here, from one to thirteen.
 Pick a number from these,
 and picture it in your head.
 Pick a number?
 Are you ready?
 Once you have your number, add four,
 and double the result.
 After that, subtract six, and divide by two.
 Finally, subtract your original number,
 and what do you have?
 Um...
 Hey, did he say to subtract six?
 Jeez, I don't know!
 I already know your answer.
 The answer is one.
 He's right!
 How?
 Seriously?
 This is very strange...
 Insane!
 A satanic magic trick!
 And he's incorporated his own
 injury into the trick!
 Why is he so calm?
 The trick is worth no points.
 That had no effect on the match,
 but he's performing tricks!
 Hisoka is being totally bizarre again!
 You may keep this as a souvenir.
 Scumbag.
 I will sever your left arm,
 so you can never mock anyone again.
 Did you not hear me the first time?
 You may have it.
 Your wish will be granted!
 Whoa! One of the Kastros is charging forward!
 Hisoka has sacrificed his one remaining arm!
 What is he thinking?!
 What?
 As expected, you attacked with your double.
 Had you, yourself, attacked,
 I would have countered.
 With this.
 Huh? His severed right arm has been restored!
 This is another magic trick.
 Can you guess the secret behind it?
 He's lying...
 He's obviously employing Nen
 to accomplish this feat.
 But what type of Nen is he using?
 What's wrong?
 Are you frightened?
 You're surprised because you
 don't understand my trick.
 That's how magic works.
 Your power to create a double
 is certainly magnificent.
 But now I understand your ability.
 I can also anticipate how you
 will attack with your double.
 And I know how to counter that attack.
 It's quite unfortunate.
 You have the talent to
 become a skilled opponent.
 That was why I spared your life.
 Here is a prediction...
 You will die, in a frenzied dance.
 Silence!
 H-How did he pick me out?
 Doubles are created in the original's image,
 so they tend to be pristine.
 But you can't recreate every
 effect of an ongoing battle.
 Oh?
 Did you not realize this?
 What is going on here?
 This sequence of events is
 impossible to understand!
 Is this another of Hisoka's tricks?
 Don't bother.
 I hit you in the chin,
 so you'll have difficulty moving for a while.
 Meaning that you won't be able
 to evade my next attack.
 What?
 Where did this attack come from?
 No, I don't have time for that...
 I must use a double to block the cards!
 You can't create another double.
 You need intense focus to
 create a double with Nen.
 The only reason you were able
 to use doubles freely
 was because you had a normal state of mind.
 Using Nen to replicate and manipulate
 something as complex as a human being
 is extremely difficult.
 Just how difficult is it?
 By the time you've learned to use a double,
 you've forgotten how to use
 Nen for anything else.
 I call that running out of memory.
 You lost because you wasted memory space.
 Kastro can no longer stand!
 Hisoka wins by knockout!
 Hisoka...
 Good work.
 Now, show me that injury.
 I was never absolutely certain,
 but today's match confirmed it.
 You are an idiot.
 Perhaps.
 Why do you endanger yourself this way?
 Was that meant as a
 performance or something?
 Who knows?
 Well, I can't complain, since I'm getting paid.
 I'll stop your bleeding first.
 Hey, hey.
 Please try to be gentle.
 Yeah, yeah. Just put away your aura.
 I'll start with the left arm.
 Here I go.
 Nen Stitches.
 Nen Stitches
 Okay, all done.
 Blood vessels, bones, nerves, and muscles.
 Basically, it's one hundred percent connected.
 An excellent job.
 Next,
 I'll do your right arm.
 Hold it yourself this time.
 I'm always mesmerized by your skill.
 Perhaps I get myself injured
 so I can watch you work your magic.
 Right.
 Twenty million for the left arm.
 Fifty million for the right.
 Pay up. Now.
 I'll send the money to your account.
 All right.
 You can treat the rest of
 your injuries yourself.
 You could provide better service.
 You should be able to manage
 with your Bungee Gum
 and Texture Surprise.
 Oh...
 I should probably conceal this.
 That way,
 they'll think my arms were
 healed during the match.
 This is an ordinary scarf,
 with no special features.
 I use Bungee Gum
 to attach it to my arm.
 Then I use Texture Surprise
 to create a layer of skin.
 He's so fast...
 That was fast enough to fool a Nen master
 into believing the arm had actually healed,
 before he even knew what was happening.
 Next, I'll do the left.
 Bungee Gum...
 Bungee Gum (Elastic Love)
 He molds his aura into a substance
 with the properties of rubber and gum.
 It can stretch, swiftly contract,
 adhere to most substances,
 and be removed at any time.
 By the way, I call this Bungee Gum
 because when I was a child,
 that was the name of my
 favorite chewing gum.
 I didn't need to know that.
 Texture Surprise...
 Texture Surprise (Flimsy Lies)
 He combines aura with the power of his imagination,
 to reproduce the appearance of skin.
 Essentially, it's a high-quality copy,
 so you can tell it's fake if you touch it.
 However, Hisoka enjoys the thrill...
 The name Texture Surprise
 comes from the stickers
 that were included with a popular snack
 a while back.
 Like I said, I didn't need to know that.
 But weren't you impressed by my application
 of these two abilities during the fight?
 Huh?
 You saw everything, didn't you?
 Well, yeah...
 As a distraction,
 you sent thirteen cards flying into the air,
 while throwing your arm and a scarf so they'd
 stick to the roof and floor with Bungee Gum.
 The aura from each was also tied
 to your right arm.
 Additionally, you connected aura to
 the thirteen cards on the floor,
 and held the ends with your left hand.
 Then,
 when you threw the ace of spades at Kastro,
 You may keep this as a souvenir.
 the aura in your left hand was released.
 And connected.
 The thirteen aura strands stuck to Kastro.
 But Kastro never noticed.
 You employed one of the basic techniques,
 Zetsu, to help mask your aura.
 However, there was a flaw...
 Yes, someone trained in Ren,
 another of the basic techniques,
 could have focused the Nen in their eyes,
 to see through your plan.
 That's why you
 used that twisted magic trick
 to throw him off guard,
 while you pretended to be
 reserving your strength.
 It even worked as camouflage,
 convincing him that your lack of aura
 was a sign of confidence.
 After meticulously confirming
 that your plan was working,
 you extended a thread of
 aura from your left hand,
 the same one holding the cards,
 and connected it to Kastro's chin.
 Your preparations were now complete.
 You'd already used Texture Surprise
 to alter the scarf on the floor
 to resemble human skin.
 And so,
 when Kastro attacked your left arm,
 you activated the Bungee Gum
 between your right arm and
 the scarf on the floor.
 Your arm was restored,
 and the scarf concealed the wound,
 leaving everyone convinced that
 your right arm was restored.
 However, this performance actually
 helped Kastro to calm down.
 It made no sense for a severed arm
 to reappear in a pristine state...
 Kastro realized that I was
 using Nen, not magic.
 But you didn't miss the subtle change
 in his psychological state.
 Your power to create a double
 is certainly magnificent.
 But now I understand your ability.
 I can also anticipate how you
 will attack with your double.
 And I know how to counter that attack.
 It's quite unfortunate.
 You have the talent to
 become a skilled opponent.
 That was why I spared your life.
 Kastro was about to recover.
 Here is a prediction...
 You will die, in a frenzied dance.
 But then you pushed him over the edge.
 Silence!
 H-How did he pick me out?
 But you can't recreate every
 effect of an ongoing battle.
 You exposed the weakness of his doubles.
 But had he stayed composed,
 he had a fair chance.
 However...
 Kastro couldn't bear the mental strain...
 And he lost.
 You realize that those two abilities
 are perfect for you.
 As opposed to Kastro's doubles,
 if my opponent knows of my abilities,
 I lose nothing because they're so adaptable.
 Well,
 I'm off.
 Already?
 My job is done, so I'm not sticking around.
 Since Nen Stitches can only do so much,
 don't overdo it until your arm's firmly attached.
 Oh, that's right.
 I came here for a reason.
 I have new orders.
 All Troupe members are to be in Yorknew City
 by noon, August 30th, not just
 those who find it convenient.
 Will the boss be coming?
 Most likely.
 This could be our biggest job yet.
 If you skip this one,
 the boss might hunt you down himself.
 How very scary.
 Then, care to join me for dinner tonight?
 A pity.
 Killua! How was Hisoka's fight?
 It was boring.
 Did Hisoka win?
 I was lying.
 It was an incredible fight.
 I hate to admit this, but I have
 no idea how Hisoka won.
 You couldn't tell?
 Gon,
 we need to learn more about Nen.
 Yeah!
 He doesn't talk.
 He doesn't talk about the past.
 He has no interest in the past.
 By tomorrow, I imagine he'll
 have forgotten Kastro's face.
 He doesn't associate with others.
 He's his own man.
 Because he believes himself
 to be the strongest.
 Oh, I forgot to remove this.
 Spider...
 I found some new toys to play with.
 I suppose it's time to start the hunt.
 Hisoka has been masquerading
 as a Phantom Troupe member.
 To him, the Phantom Troupe
 is simply another target.

 An x Empty x Threat
 After two months, during which Gon
 was forbidden to practice Nen,
 Wing has summoned Gon
 and Killua to see him.
 Gon-kun. Killua-kun.
 Starting today, you'll train with Zushi.
 Gon-kun, I'm pleased
 that you kept your word.
 It's thanks to your promise thread.
 A few times, I almost gave in.
 But when I looked at the thread,
 I was able to control myself.
 That's because I added some Nen to help you.
 Huh? Really?
 No, I was lying.
 Huh?
 But how could you tell that he kept his word?
 He could have been practicing in secret.
 Because the promise thread remained intact.
 Gon-kun, it's been a while,
 but would you try using Ten ?
 It's okay?
 Yes.
 Crap, do I remember how to do this?
 It's been so long.
 Can I still pull it off?
 Zushi, what do you think?
 I-It's amazing!
 His aura is flowing all around him!
 Soft and calm...
 But it's very strong!
 I did it!
 Whew...
 I was worried that I might
 have forgotten how.
 Once you've learned the technique,
 you can't forget it.
 However, to become a master,
 you'll have to train hard.
 But it felt easier than before,
 despite not having been practicing Ten.
 That's because
 you were training your spirit each day.
 Now, look at your left hand.
 Huh?
 It snapped!
 By applying my own Nen,
 I tied the thread such that
 if you broke your promise and used Nen,
 it would snap.
 That's actually possible?
 Hey, Wing-san...
 Did you watch Kastro and Hisoka's match?
 Yes, I did.
 What was the ability that Hisoka used?
 Could we send loose limbs flying around?
 Hmm, that's a difficult question.
 Gon-kun, have you seen the fight on video?
 No, not yet.
 Then I'll explain while we watch.
 Can you see the threads of aura
 extending from his left hand?
 Threads of aura?
 Yes.
 Do you see them?
 N-Nope.
 I can't see a thing.
 Same here.
 Are there really threads of aura
 coming from Hisoka's left hand?
 Yes, Hisoka is using a technique
 that makes his aura difficult to perceive.
 Null
 It's a high-level application of Zetsu, known as In.
 Hide
 When you use In,
 even the strongest opponents will
 find it hard to see your aura.
 The most effective counter to this technique
 Enhance
 is to focus the aura created by Ren
 into your eyes, a technique called Gyo.
 Focus
 The method Gon-kun used
 in his fight with Gido
 might work, as well.
 However, you couldn't take offensive action,
 so ultimately, you'd throw your life away.
 Right.
 My assignment for you two
 is to practice Ren until you
 can see through Hisoka's In.
 Eh?
 Uh, master?
 What should I do?
 Zushi,
 you should already be strong
 enough to see past his In.
 I should?
 Show them your Ren.
 O-Osu!
 Ren!
 It's so strong.
 It doesn't have a much greater magnitude,
 but it's very dense.
 Then direct that aura into your eyes.
 Osu!
 Gyo!
 So, can you see the aura that emanates
 from Hisoka's body?
 Yes.
 And how many threads are there?
 Twelve...
 No, I think it's thirteen.
 Not quite.
 But you were close.
 I could really see them!
 You're making excellent progress, Zushi.
 O-Osu...
 Thank you very much.
 By channeling all your power through Gyo,
 you achieved a level where you
 could see through Hisoka's In.
 But with enough training,
 you'll be able to use Gyo while fighting.
 Do you understand?
 First, practice Ren,
 and master the Ren application known as Gyo.
 Then you'll discover the true nature
 of Hisoka's ability.
 And will you be able to use that same ability?
 My answer is both yes and no.
 Regardless of what Hisoka's precise power is,
 so long as it uses Nen, you can learn it.
 However,
 Nen powers depend on the
 particular individual.
 Each of us possesses different
 specialties and preferences.
 Thus, Nen differs for each person.
 If you're serious about mastering Nen,
 you shouldn't merely copy others' abilities.
 It's important that you first identify
 your own strengths.
 Strengths...
 You've only just begun to develop.
 You haven't settled on one form yet.
 Initially, try to grow as much as you can.
 That is the purpose of this training.
 Train hard,
 play hard, and enjoy life.
 Osu!
 The final day of Killua-kun's
 window to fight is June 9th,
 and Gon-kun's is the 10th, correct?
 I'd like you both to register for your final day.
 In the meantime, you'll train.
 You must learn Gyo
 before it's time for your battle.
 Osu!
 Your Ren was impressive, Zushi.
 You moved way ahead while I was resting.
 No, I still have a long path before me.
 Hey, let's practice what we just learned.
 Yeah, then let's go to your room, Gon.
 Okay.
 Killua... Zushi.
 Osu!
 We have company.
 You guys don't know when to quit.
 That's why no one likes you.
 Oh, don't be so harsh.
 Tell me when you're going to fight,
 because I'd love to be your opponent.
 I guess they specialize in hunting newbies.
 They want to rack up wins
 by beating us up.
 We're getting desperate...
 Because our deadline is nearing.
 Come on, let's fight.
 I'll even demonstrate my power
 right now.
 I'm fighting on June 10th.
 Hey, Gon!
 That won't work.
 My deadline is May 29th.
 Fight on that day.
 Who cares about your deadline, moron?
 Let's go.
 Gon-chan...
 You and I will fight.
 I guarantee it.
 Gon, ignore him.
 What will you do?
 I'll force him to fight me.
 Visualize the energy building in your body.
 Power gathers in each cell, and grows.
 Then you force that power
 out!
 I'm getting used to this.
 Learning when to shroud the
 boosted aura with Ten
 was a little tricky.
 A-A little?
 They pick it up too fast!
 But our auras still aren't as strong as Zushi's.
 Guess we should practice more.
 N-No, that's enough!
 Learning when to rest is part of training.
 Let's call it a day.
 Really? I can stillâ€”
 No!
 If they pass me in half a day,
 I'll lose all my motivation...
 Oh...
 Well, it's okay.
 We'll practice more tomorrow.
 Yeah.
 See you tomorrow.
 Bye.
 Okay, then...
 I can't...
 I can't move!
 I can't talk or breathe...
 What's going on?
 Oops.
 Please...
 Forget it.
 I figured you were up to something.
 But you don't need dirty tricks
 to make me fight you.
 When do you want to fight?
 Don't worry.
 I'll let you win.
 I'll even give you each a win.
 Is that good enough?
 After I get my win off you,
 I'm going to fight Gon-chan.
 If you want to fight Gon,
 you'll have to follow his schedule.
 He'll be more than happy to fight you.
 I can promise you that.
 Okay.
 If you two are willing to fight,
 we don't need to bother with this.
 Let's go register together.
 Once that's done, I'll return the boy unharmed.
 Yeah, yeah. Sure...
 But only this once.
 May 29th...
 Okay, happy now?
 Yes,
 we'll return him.
 Oh, just to reiterate, it's a one-time deal.
 If you break your promise...
 Eh... Whatever.
 Forget it.
 What? You got me curious.
 What will happen if we break our promise?
 No point in telling you now.
 Just keep your word.
 Hello? Is this Gon-kun?
 I'm sure you'll understand what this means.
 As long as you don't tell anyone,
 and you follow my instructions,
 the three of you will be able to
 train as usual tomorrow.
 Zushi...
 How did it go with Gon-chan?
 Perfect.
 He's registered for the 30th.
 That's two wins.
 Too easy.
 Not killing people is pretty hard.
 Clean living's tough...
 Come on down! We have tickets!
 These are fresh off the press...
 Gon versus Sadaso!
 And here's Killua versus Sadaso...
 If you don't buy now, you'll regret it!
 Pops.
 Yep?
 Does Sadaso have only one arm?
 Yeah, the one-armed fighter,
 with the mask-like face.
 If he catches you with his
 invisible left arm, you're finished.
 They call him the newbie crusher...
 That bastard.
 Huh? Killua?
 Gon, you were here?
 Y-Yeah...
 Killua-kun,
 I believe you helped Zushi last night.
 Thank you.
 You feeling all right?
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 I was probably tired.
 Sorry to worry you!
 Oh, Wing-san...
 Can we watch that video again?
 I've learned how to use Gyo.
 Really?
 Fifteen threads, right?
 Thirteen for the cards, one for the scarf,
 and a well hidden one that
 leads to the arm he tossed.
 Continue.
 Hisoka is...
 Hisoka's aura appears
 to expand and contract.
 Or does it
 attract certain objects, similar to a magnet?
 Why else would his arm reattach?
 Or fly into his opponent's chin?
 It's probably the former.
 His aura is elastic, like rubber.
 That would explain most of his tricks.
 He's on a completely different level!
 Very good... You pass.
 But I am surprised...
 I didn't expect you both to learn Gyo overnight.
 Gon?
 Uh-huh,
 but I still couldn't figure out Hisoka's power.
 So, Killua-kun,
 since you finished your assignment,
 I assume you want to fight, yes?
 O-Oh, I wasn't trying to
 beat you to the punch.
 I just got an itch to fight.
 Yeah, I get it.
 Gon, they must have threatened you.
 Actually, I've already chosen my day to fight.
 May 29th.
 Mine's May 30th.
 That's fine.
 I underestimated how fast you could learn.
 Spend the remaining days practicing Ten and Ren.
 Be sure you get plenty
 of practice, rest, and sleep.
 Osu!
 Killua...
 They must have threatened you.
 Now I'm mad...
 Yeah, but my biggest concern
 was the master, and he agreed.
 But I'm worried they'll use Zushi again.
 It'll be okay.
 You don't need to worry.
 Today, I'll beat Killua-chan for my sixth win.
 Tomorrow, I'll beat Gon-chan
 for my seventh win.
 Then I just need to find three more chumps.
 And I'll be a Floor Master.
 I'll get all the wealth and glory to
 set me up for the rest of my life.
 Move, and I will kill you...
 Use Nen, and I will kill you.
 Make a sound, and I will kill you.
 If you understand, slowly close your eyes.
 Do you know what happens
 if you break your word?
 If you know, slowly open your eyes.
 Look at me in the mirror, and listen carefully.
 Never show your filthy face to us again.
 That's a promise.
 Time has run out for Sadaso!
 Killua wins by default!
 Damn, I want my money back!
 Killua opens the battle
 against the persistent trio
 with a win by default.
 Thanks to their inborn talent,
 Gon and Killua are learning Nen
 at incredible speeds.
 Now they will start the real battle
 at Heavens Arena.

 The 251-story, 991-meter building
 is a mecca for fighters.
 When combatants win a fight,
 they may advance by one class,
 and receive a corresponding reward.

 you are assigned a private room.
 After reaching the 200th floor,
 you receive the right to challenge
 the strongest fighters,
 the Floor Masters, in an

 Power x To x Avenge
 There are many who would use
 underhanded tactics to become a Floor Master.
 On the other hand,
 Gon has concentrated on improving
 his Nen and growing stronger.
 And tonight,
 he has his battle with Sadaso.
 His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.
 I was overcome with despair.
 The second he looked at me,
 I felt a difference in strength
 that made me realize my
 helplessness against him.
 It was a mistake to underestimate him,
 and to assume he was some normal kid.
 I'm gonna disappear
 because I don't wanna die...
 Be careful.
 You guys are next.
 What should we do?
 I'm still in.
 I'll do whatever it takes.
 I'm this close to becoming a Floor Master.
 Ten victories in the 200s
 win you the right to challenge a Floor Master.
 Should you triumph, you get
 an entire floor to yourself.
 And once you've earned the
 title of Floor Master,
 you can lecture, serve as an advisor,
 or start a new martial arts school.
 You can live off the title for
 the rest of your life.
 Will that kid try threatening us?
 The boy doesn't know my power.
 As long as we're careful, we can handle him.
 You're wrong.
 It's irrelevant to me what your power is.
 I can threaten you whenever I want.
 Whenever and wherever I choose...
 When you're sound asleep...
 When you're taking a dump.
 Got it?
 Now, listen up.
 You have to follow the rules.
 Without rules,
 we are the ones who would benefit.
 Cheating really is a bad idea.
 We'll have a fair fight.
 Right.
 Time has run out for Sadaso.
 Gon wins by default!

 Okay, Gon-kun is fighting Gido today.
 Killua-kun will be facing Riehlvelt.
 Are you feeling all right?
 Yes.
 Gon-kun, this will be your
 second match with Gido.
 So you shouldn't require much advice.
 Do you have a plan?
 Uh-huh.
 Um, Wing-san, actually...
 I'm planning to use this.
 I see...
 Okay, today is the long-awaited grudge match...
 Gido versus Gon.
 In their previous encounter,
 Gon ended up in the hospital,
 but what will happen this time?
 Today, he's carrying a fishing rod.
 How does he plan to use it?
 How does he intend to fight?
 Let's get this contest started!
 Points and KO system.
 No time limit!
 Begin!
 Wow! Gon's already taken off!
 But Gido was also prepared, as he's
 already using Tornado Top!
 If Gon charges in,
 he'll be in the same position as before.
 So he anticipated that.
 I know exactly what you're thinking...
 Once I've begun to spin,
 it's extremely hard to stop me.
 Thus, the logical course
 would be a preemptive attack before I start.
 What's wrong?
 If you won't make a move, I'll go first.
 Shotgun Blues!
 Shotgun Blues
 He can dispatch his tops, even while spinning?
 This technique is nothing like Battle Waltz.
 Every top will be aiming for you.
 You can't avoid them all!
 Ren!
 What?
 He stopped them!
 Did you see that?
 Wow...
 Incredible!
 He stopped the tops in their tracks!
 He clearly isn't the same
 person as two months ago!
 His Nen defense is far stronger now.
 I can't win with my tops?
 Gon's reflexes are good enough
 to let him use his rod to knock down any tops
 that are stupid enough to come straight at him.
 But he chose to use Ren
 to deal more psychological damage.
 He must be pretty mad
 about how they used Zushi.
 It's my turn now!
 Well, what technique will Gon use?
 If he's attacking with that fishing rod, I'd guess
 he'll try to snag me, to stop my spinning.
 But it won't be that simple.
 There he goes...
 Straight for Gido!
 I knew it.
 But that won't do you any good!
 Oh, his attack missed!
 What were you aiming at?
 What?!
 Unbelievable...
 Gon pulled up the floor, with Gido on it!
 Wait!
 G-Gon has broken Gido's prosthetic leg.
 Gido can no longer continue to fight.
 If you're willing to do whatever it takes,
 I won't hold back.
 And if you touch Zushi again,
 I'll smash your face in!
 Our winner is Gon!
 Gon was able to avenge his initial loss!
 His record in the 200s is now 2-1!
 Okay, it's my turn now.
 All right, up next is our main event...
 Killua versus Riehlvelt!
 Because Sadaso forfeited the previous match,
 this will technically be Killua's debut 200s match.
 What will his strategy be?
 You're the ones who broke your promise.
 I won't let you win now.
 His eyes reflected his underworld affiliations.
 An underworld dweller, huh?
 This boy may be a professional there,
 but Heavens Arena is my turf.
 I'll show him that, on this square stage,
 I'm better.
 Fight, Killua-san!
 Points and KO system.
 No time limit!
 Begin!
 He disappeared?
 Behind me!
 Aura Burst!
 Aura Burst
 Wow, he's dashed out of harm's way!
 He uses the propulsion created
 by releasing his stored aura
 to control his wheelchair at will.
 I moved too fast.
 Whew, that was close...
 Twin Snakes:
 Song of Defense!
 Song of Defense
 There it is!
 His Song of Defense...
 Riehlvelt protects himself with two
 whips moving at ridiculous speed,
 while he awaits his opportunity to strike.
 You planned to attack first and take the lead.
 Too bad it didn't work...
 Now that I've switched to this stance,
 you have no chance of winning.
 Why not?
 That should be obvious.
 A normal person can't even see the whips move!
 And this small ring offers no
 means to hide or escape.
 Take this!
 Sorry, but I'm not a normal person.
 What?!
 But...
 Thunder Snake!
 True Twin Snakes: Thunder Snake
 I'm astonished, Killua.
 You're the first person I've fought
 who could see my whips move.
 So I have a present for you...
 Together, my whips carry a
 one million volt current.
 Enough to paralyze and
 incapacitate the largest of men.
 Any fool who resists my whips
 will fall prey to Thunder Snake!
 I'm accustomed to electrical currents
 from the torture training I've endured.
 It has no effect on me.
 But that just means I can bear the pain.
 It still hurts.
 That's why I'm a little pissed.
 If you fall from that height, you'll die!
 What do you want?
 P-Please catch me!
 Okay.
 Just come to me.
 Man, you realize how painful it is now, idiot?
 Riehlvelt has been knocked unconscious.
 Our winner is Killua!
 Nice, Killua!
 You're up next.
 You're fighting him in six days?
 Uh-huh, June 10th.
 My win was only possible
 because of who I am...
 If you're hit by those electric whips,
 you'll be knocked out cold.
 Yeah.
 What's your plan?
 Don't worry. I have an idea.
 Oh?
 In spirit, you were fighting
 even as you watched me.
 I guess you prefer actual combat
 to being a spectator.
 June 9th
 It appears that the damage
 Gido suffered in his match
 with Gon was so severe,
 he hasn't returned for today's fight.
 Killua wins by default.
 June 10th
 After losing to Killua,
 Riehlvelt's record stands at 5-3,
 leaving him no more chances.
 As you know, after four losses,
 you're out of the contest.
 You'll have to start over from the beginning.
 He appears wary of Gon's speed,
 as he already has his whips out.
 Meanwhile, Gon isn't carrying his fishing rod...
 How does he plan to fight?
 Begin!
 Oh, Riehlvelt opened with Song of Defense!
 Riehlvelt is attempting to end the fight now!
 Oh, Gon is squatting?
 Amazing...
 He pried a floor tile loose by himself!
 And then he threw it!
 Aura Burst!
 Whoa, he barely managed to escape!
 He left that escape route open on purpose.
 What?
 However, Gon has already anticipated him.
 When you try to escape,
 every fraction of a second counts.
 And since there isn't time to change direction,
 you're forced to move forward...
 And when you dash quickly,
 you're usually off-balance.
 His only option is to stop the whips.
 That's where you get him...
 This is the switch?
 Let's see...
 I'll turn the power to maximum.
 S-Stop...
 Switch
 Stop it!
 on!
 Just kidding.
 Riehlvelt has fallen unconscious.
 Our winner is Gon!
 Gon-san!
 Yes, that truly was impressive.
 I can see the progress you've made
 from these last two fights.
 Feel free to pick a time and place...
 I shall be your opponent.
 Hisoka has recognized the strength
 Gon demonstrated during his matches.
 Their fight will soon begin.

 Feel free to pick a time and place...
 I shall be your opponent.
 The x True x Pass
 Gon has obtained Hisoka's consent to fight him,
 so he continues to train hard in Nen to prepare.
 Today, we will finally begin to train in Hatsu.
 Act
 Once you master Hatsu,
 you will have learned the basic Nen principles.
 After that, you will need to work
 on developing your individual Nen style.
 Osu!
 Hatsu is the technique
 by which you control your Nen.
 It is the culmination of Nen,
 and there are six distinct categories.
 Enhancer
 Enhancers are able to strengthen objects.
 Emitter
 Emitters can propel their aura.
 Transmuter
 Transmuters can alter their aura's qualities.
 Conjurer
 Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.
 Manipulator
 Manipulators can use their aura
 to control objects and creatures.
 Specialist
 Specialists are those with a
 special aura that doesn't fall
 within the other five classes.
 The key is to find the power that suits you.
 Enhancer
 Emitter
 Transmuter
 Conjurer
 Manipulator
 Specialist
 The power that suits you?
 Nen is linked to individual ability,
 with two areas of particular prominence.
 The first would be your natural potential.
 The second would be potential
 refined later in life.
 Gon-kun, for example,
 was born with a flexible, springy body.
 His acute senses were the product
 of a childhood spent in nature.
 From the moment of birth, your Nen aura
 falls within one of the six categories.
 While rare, it is possible for your
 Nen aura to later change types.
 If you attempt to learn an ability
 that does not fit your inclination,
 you will find it very difficult.
 Act
 Enhancer
 Transmuter
 Conjurer
 Specialist
 Emitter
 Manipulator
 This hexagon depicts the relationship
 among the six categories.
 The closer a class is to your own,
 the higher your compatibility to learn it.
 If you are born with an aura
 of the Enhancer category,
 you will find Enhancer abilities easiest
 to learn and master.
 And the adjacent Transmuter and Emitter classes
 will also be easy to learn.
 On the other hand, the Specialist class,
 which is furthest away, would be difficult.
 To illustrate, I'll use skills
 that you've seen for yourselves.
 Hisoka was able to change
 his aura into a rubbery substance.
 This would be a Transmuter ability.
 Gido used his tops and body as
 weapons by making them spin faster,
 which would be an Enhancer power.
 However, since using so many tops as weapons
 also requires Manipulator skill,
 he wasn't as successful.
 As for Kastro,
 his Tiger Bite was incredibly strong.
 Had he mastered it, he would have
 been among the strongest Nen users.
 I believe that his aura fell
 into the Enhancer class.
 However, he focused his energy on
 the power to create a double,
 which is a Conjurer skill.
 And he also required a Manipulator
 ability to control the double.
 Both of those are relatively far
 from the Enhancer category.
 So neither was compatible
 with an Enhancer type?
 Indeed, it requires a great deal of work and
 natural talent to learn an incompatible ability.
 And as a result,
 he squandered most of his Nen potential.
 So he made the wrong choice.
 He was a great fighter...
 It's a shame.
 Well?
 Do you see the importance
 of understanding your own
 auras and inclinations?
 Osu!
 Given that,
 is there any way to learn which
 category your aura falls into?
 There is.
 Water Divination,
 a Shingen-ryu technique for classifying your aura.
 It's also used in Hatsu training.
 You place your hands beside
 the cup, and use Ren.
 The result will reveal your category.
 The water's overflowing...
 If the amount of water changes,
 that means you are an Enhancer.
 This shows that my aura falls
 within the Enhancer class.
 Okay, now it's your turn.
 Gon's an Enhancer, too?
 The leaf moved!
 If the leaf moves, that makes you a Manipulator.
 Okay, I'm last!
 Nothing's happening.
 Indeed...
 The leaf isn't moving.
 Do I not have any potential?
 Not at all.
 Taste the water.
 Taste it?
 It might be a little sweet...
 You're right.
 Yes, it's a bit sweet.
 Isn't this just water?
 It's just water.
 But the taste changed.
 Because of Killua-kun's aura.
 And that means?
 You are a Transmuter.
 Oh!
 A Transmuter?
 Now, you three know
 how your auras are classified.
 Use the next four weeks
 to train hard, so the Water Divination
 results become more pronounced.
 Osu!

 Master, what about me?
 You still need to train a bit more.
 Osu.
 Keep at it.
 You can do it!
 Osu...
 And, Gon-kun...
 Huh?
 I have something important to tell you.
 Something important?
 Gon Freecss-kun, you have passed
 the Secret Hunter Exam!
 Huh?
 You've passed.
 Congratulations.
 The Secret Hunter Exam?
 Correct.
 You were able to pass.
 What do you mean?
 You are required to learn Nen
 before becoming a Hunter,
 as professional Hunters are
 expected to be exceptionally strong.
 One of your basic tasks
 as a Hunter will be apprehending
 evil poachers and criminals.
 You must be strong enough to fight crime.
 However, this power is highly
 destructive when used for wrongdoing.
 Revealing the existence of Nen
 during the Exam would be dangerous.
 Therefore,
 the test is only administered to
 those who pass the public Exam.
 Oh, so you were going to teach us,
 or at least Gon, all along...
 Yes.
 I should mention that the
 head Shingen-ryu master
 is Chairman Netero.
 The master has told me much about you.
 That old man...
 Killua-kun.
 Please take the Hunter Exam again.
 You will definitely pass next time.
 Huh?
 Yeah.
 You are more than qualified.
 I guarantee it.
 Yeah, if I feel up to it.
 Hey, Wing-san...
 Have you heard anything about
 the others who passed?
 Sure.
 Hanzo and Kurapika
 have learned Nen from other teachers.
 Pokkle is struggling with Ren.
 Leorio has begun studying for
 the medical school exam.
 Hisoka and Illumi already knew Nen,
 so they were qualified.
 Then Kurapika and Leorio are working hard.
 Yeah.
 Now, Gon-kun,
 I have one warning for you.
 When you fight Hisoka tomorrow,
 don't push yourself too hard.
 All right?
 Yes, sir!
 Zushi, you will continue
 training for four more weeks.
 Osu...
 You should have more confidence.
 You are progressing at an incredible pace.
 You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent.
 One in a hundred thousand?
 O-Osu!
 However,
 those two are one-in-ten-million talents.
 Osu!
 That doesn't make me feel any better, master...
 But...
 One day,
 I will definitely catch up!
 Hello, everyone!
 In the arena today, we have Gon versus Hisoka.
 This is the fight you've all been waiting for.
 As you can see, the stands are packed.
 The tension in the air before the
 start of this match is almost unreal!
 How much longer?
 Get this thing started!
 Gon is the first to arrive!
 After four fights, he has a 3-1 record.
 He's on a roll!
 You can do it, Gon!
 Don't you need your fishing rod?
 You can't catch Hisoka with your bare hands!
 And next, with a fiery display...
 Hisoka appears!
 His lethal battle with Kastro is still fresh
 in everyone's minds.
 His record is 9-3.
 If he wins, he can challenge a Floor Master.
 If he loses, he falls all the way down.
 However, he has yet to lose
 when he steps into the ring!
 Will his undefeated record continue?
 Oh...
 Don't look at me like that.

 Who will make the first move?
 It's Gon!
 A clean hit!
 One point to Hisoka!
 Wh-What an intense exchange.
 I never even got to sneak in a word!
 What's wrong?
 I still haven't moved a step from where I started.
 Huh? Really?
 Damn!
 Just you wait!
 Okay, I don't have to try to
 hit him with every attack.
 I can use some feints to get the same effect.
 Hisoka's enjoying himself.
 In terms of actual skill,
 there's an insurmountable gap.
 But he still has a weakness.
 Hisoka knows that he's stronger,
 so he won't retreat.
 That gives Gon an opening!
 In that case, I'll try that!
 There it is!
 Gon's Stone Flip!
 He shattered the block to
 create a hail of rubble.
 Gon...
 Where is he?
 Gon has finally landed a solid hit on Hisoka.
 However, he will soon receive a taste
 of Hisoka's true power.

 He's come back to take a 2-1 lead.

 I have no idea!
 How much have you learned
 about Nen?
 All of the basics.
 I see.
 You must be an Enhancer.
 H-How did you know?
 You're so adorable...
 You should do a better job
 of keeping a secret.
 Shut up!
 How did you know?
 I used a method similar to the
 blood type personality test.
 And it's just as unreliable.
 I devised my own way of using
 personality to classify aura.
 Enhancers are simple and earnest.
 He nailed it.
 He's right.
 By the way, I'm a Transmuter,
 fickle and dishonest.
 It fits.
 He nailed it.
 Emitters have short tempers.
 Specialists are independent.
 Conjurers are high-strung.
 Manipulators are argumentative.
 The two of us are quite compatible.
 Our opposing personalities attract.
 We could become very intimate.
 But you should take care,
 because Transmuters are fickle.
 It takes a mere second for
 treasure to turn to trash.
 So...
 Do not disappoint me, Gon.
 He's fast!
 Wh-What a strong kick.
 He sent that stone block flying
 all the way to the entrance!
 Fast, fast, fast!
 Hisoka is demonstrating his true power.
 Critical for Hisoka!
 Add points.
 3-2!
 His nonstop flurry of attacks has been scored
 as a critical strike.
 He's regained the lead.
 Gon appears to be confused...
 Does he have no way to fight back?
 He's backing off.
 Amazing...
 Too amazing.
 What's wrong?
 Attack me.
 Forget it.
 I'm brainstorming!
 I can just barely follow him by eye,
 but the rest of my body can't keep up.
 At this rate, he'll beat the crap out of me!
 Very well.
 Then I'll have to force you
 to come over here...
 Gon, use Gyo !
 Crap!
 Do you understand
 what is happening?
 Gon has been drawn toward Hisoka!
 This is my Elastic Love...
 Also known as Bungee Gum.
 It can expand and contract.
 And attach and detach as I desire...
 You won't be able to escape.
 Critical and down.
 Plus three points to Hisoka.
 6-2!
 Hisoka hits him with a strong straight right!
 Gon is down!
 He turns his aura into a rubbery substance
 capable of attaching to other objects.
 Bungee Gum.
 Tsk.
 Only Hisoka can attach and detach it.
 Stand up, Gon...
 Damn.
 The score is 6-2.
 Hisoka increases his lead.
 Will his undefeated record continue?
 Stand up, kid!
 Hey, ref! You're helping Hisoka too much!
 You can do it!
 Can you fight?
 Of course.
 Oh, Gon is standing...
 But he's sustained significant damage!
 Okay, I have a question for you.
 Huh?
 If you answer correctly, I'll give you a free hit.
 What?
 When did I attach my Bungee Gum to your cheek?
 When did he attach his Gum?
 One...
 When I elbowed you.
 Two...
 When I landed a clean hit.
 Three...
 When I landed a critical strike?
 When was it?
 Three! When you hit me with both hands!
 Wrong!
 The answer is four.
 When I was giving you my
 aura personality analysis.
 That's dirty!
 Damn.
 If I had been using Gyo from the beginning...
 Now, I have a warning for you.
 Had you been using Gyo,
 you would have been able to notice my aura,
 and you could have avoided it
 during my aura personality analysis.
 However, what about situations
 one, two, and three?
 Have you figured it out?
 I could have also attached my Bungee Gum
 while directly attacking you.
 You only need to conceal your aura when you
 wish to catch your opponent off guard.
 Normally, you use your aura while attacking.
 It doesn't matter if your
 opponent sees your aura
 when you're landing attacks.
 He's right.
 If I can't dodge Hisoka's attacks,
 using Gyo to see his aura won't help!
 This is bad.
 His power's far more difficult to
 handle than I expected!
 So you have to dodge all of Hisoka's attacks
 if you want to avoid his Bungee Gum.
 But if you're able to defend...
 No, defending won't work.
 Even if you block, he can still attach
 his aura to the part you block with.
 I can't escape.
 What should I do?
 Okay, that's enough talk.
 Let us prepare for battle.
 Resume.
 If I can't escape,
 I'll go to him!
 Gon...
 Gon!
 Good...
 You're so good.
 Those eyes.
 That look.
 That spirit...
 I can't wait
 to break you.
 But not yet...
 More...
 More!
 Until I can no longer bear to ruin you.
 Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!
 Once you've matured...
 Rush! Rush! Rush! Rush!
 Until you've reached soaring new heights...
 I must wait.
 A vicious rush!
 Oh, not again!
 Hisoka draws Gon into another
 punch from his left fist!
 Good.
 I managed to block that!
 I'm getting used to being dragged
 around by his Bungee Gum.
 This isn't over.
 It's not over yet!
 I'm scared...
 But if I let my fear overcome me,
 I'll never be able to beat anyone else!
 Critical for both sides!
 Plus two points!
 Plus a knockdown for Hisoka!
 What?
 Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
 and 4 points for Gon!
 I was never knocked down!
 I got right back up!
 I even blocked his attack!
 What?
 Something's wrong with this ref!
 Are you blind?
 Oh, we have another strange call.
 In response to the ref's decision,
 the crowd has filled the arena with boos.
 Fight!
 If he gets ten points, I lose.
 I only have one point left.
 He doesn't need to knock me down.
 If I get hit by any attack, it's over!
 You must be more vigilant, Gon.
 Look to the right.
 Oh, sorry.
 I meant my right.
 Down, and clean hit!
 Plus two points.
 11-4.
 The winner, by, TKO, is...
 Hisoka!
 Huh?
 While you were complaining to the referee,
 I sent the aura on my left hand to the stone.
 Total scores are now 9 points for Hisoka,
 and 4 points for Gon!
 Then I immediately activated Bungee Gum.
 So...
 It's really over?
 You've made incredible progress.
 But you lack experience.
 About ten more fights, and you
 should stand a better chance.
 If we're in Heavens Arena, at least.
 Therefore,
 I will not fight you here again.
 Next time,
 we'll fight in the real world,
 without any rules to restrain us.
 With our lives on the line.
 He's so far away...
 But he's not out of reach.
 I need more training in Nen...
 To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!
 With this victory, Hisoka has
 earned his tenth win
 and the right to challenge a Floor Master!
 Gon has fought bravely, and we wish
 him the best in his next match.
 So that's all for now.
 This is your commentator, Cocco, signing off!
 A referee is supposed to be completely impartial.
 But given today's matchup,
 I thought it prudent
 to end the fight as quickly as possible,
 even if it meant lowering my standards.
 So he's a technical ref.
 What does that mean?
 If a ref believes that a
 fight may get dangerous,
 he'll award points like crazy, to finish it quickly.
 You have to take that into
 consideration when placing a bet.
 Man, I was certain that Hisoka would win 10-0...
 I have nothing to say to you
 about the fight with Hisoka.
 You were the one fighting him,
 so I'm sure you understand best of all.
 Understand what?
 What he learned from that fight.
 Yes!
 Gon, what did you learn?
 A secret.
 Gon-kun, Killua-kun...
 You will need to master
 your own styles of Nen,
 as you continue down your chosen paths.
 Yes!
 Yeah.
 I'm glad I was able to meet you.
 You've set a worthy mark for me to surpass!
 You think you can pass us?
 One day, for sure!
 Won't happen.
 I can't wait to see you do it, Zushi.
 Osu!
 Well, let's go.
 Yeah.
 Thank you for everything, Wing-san!
 Yeah, same here.
 Thank you.
 Take care, you two.
 Zushi, until we meet again!
 Osu!
 Well, you finally accomplished
 your objective, right?
 Uh-huh.
 Then we don't have any more business here.
 Gon, what are you going to do?
 Go back to Whale Island.
 Whale Island?
 Uh-huh.
 I was able to return the favor to Hisoka,
 so I want to go back to the island,
 and show Mito-san my license.
 It's been over half a year since I left...
 I guess I'll come with you.
 Huh?
 I'd like to meet Mito-san.
 Really?
 Then let's go together.
 Yeah, I'll just tag along.
 Bye-bye, Heavens Arena.
 Gon was able to land a punch on Hisoka
 and return the tag, as he'd promised.
 Despite losing the fight,
 Gon was satisfied after meeting his goal.
 Brush Your Teeth.

 Gon!
 Gon learned that he still
 has a ways to go,
 Me?
 Gon became my first friend,
 after we met during the Hunter Exam.

 repaying an old debt.
 He's fun to be around because
 his expressions are always changing,
 He's intent on getting stronger.
 and you can't ever tell what he's thinking.
 Next time: Ging x And x Gon!
 Hey, Killua, wanna come to my place?
 I-I-I can't do much,
 but thank you for letting me stay!
 You're stuttering.
