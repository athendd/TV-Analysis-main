{"Name": "Stand by Me", "Types": ["Unknown"], "Description": "An ability meant for assassination that Yushohi starts by summoning a Stinger Ball , Needle Ball), an insect-sized orb with four wings and a needle, to which he assigns a target. After an incubation period of unspecified length, the ability kills the target through unknown means. The incubation period is much longer for non-users than for Nen users. Stand by Me is terminated if the target moves more than 20 meters away from Yushohi, who is not notified about the ability's deactivation. If a Stinger Ball is found and removed from the target, the ability can never be used on that target again.Since the buzzing sound of a Stinger Ball can only be heard by Nen users, the ability also allows Yushohi to tell them apart from non-users. It is unclear whether this is because the construct is emitted or because it is part of a Conjuration ability which Yushohi has designed to be perceivable only by Nen users. Regardless of the Nen type involved in its manifestation, a degree of Manipulation may also be required.", "Character_Name": "Yushohi"}
{"Name": "Predator", "Types": ["Conjuration"], "Description": "Once Rihan has selected a target and activated his Nen ability, a Predator begins to grow inside his body. The more accurate his understanding of the target's ability, the better the Predator will be able to counter it, figuratively developing into its natural predator. When Rihan has gathered enough information, he focuses his aura between his hands and breathes out, conjuring the Predator. The one that countered Prince Sal\u00e9-sal\u00e9's Guardian Spirit Beast swallowed it and its small replica above Koroabde's head, then replaced it at the prince's side. Despite being conjured, this Predator was invisible to the non-users in the room. Rihan remarked that his ability is an inaccurate spray and pray weapon that carries a lot of risk, but an auto-win if it connects.Since it draws strength from the accuracy of Rihan's analysis from a state of complete ignorance, Predator is powerless against simple Enhancement and Emission attacks, also due to the target being the ability user themselves, who is likely to retaliate. Furthermore, it is at a disadvantage against opponents with counteractive or multiple abilities. As an added condition, Rihan must gather the required information by himself, since taking less risks and being told about the targeted ability by a third party would result in Predator being too weak to neutralize it. After it successfully counters a Nen ability, Rihan is unable to use any Nen for 48 hours.", "Character_Name": "Rihan"}

This ability earned him Razor's praise. Like Goreinu's other Nen beast, the black gorilla is not on autopilot, meaning it will disappear if he loses consciousness.

The life energy is transferred to the tip of the Nen beast's tail, which turns white and begins to glow. The cat-like construct then pours the life essence into Camilla's mouth, healing her injuries completely and resurrecting her. This ability relies on post-mortem Nen to boost its power, rendering Camilla virtually impossible to kill; however, the fact that death is its activation condition prevents her from negating damage she suffers without dying, and leaves Camilla powerless should the opponent not attack her directly.

When a member of the group thus created kills someone, they level up, increasing their aura amount and output. Upon reaching level 20, they will manifest a unique ability of which they will have at least a general knowledge before using it. At level 100, they also become Member Zero, and are thus capable of using this ability to create their own community. Morena herself assigns the scores. For the voyage on the Black Whale, she decreed that the death of a non-user is worth 1 level, that of a Nen user 10 levels, and that of a prince 50 levels. Morena herself is level 45. There are three conditions that Morena must fulfill in any order before she can infect someone: Both she and the other person must play her negotiation card game, and Yes must be the player's last card. This condition has also been referred to as a Limitation, specifically one tied to the risks both the player and she take as part of her negotiation card game. Morena must kiss the other person. The other person must be present while Morena or one of her allies commits a murder. Until all three conditions are fulfilled, a target kissed by Morena is level 0 and gains no benefit from Contagion. In addition to granting and bolstering their Nen abilities, Morena is aware of the location, status, number of points, and level of any target that is at least level 0. Although unconfirmed, she may also be able to perceive anything an affected target sees and hears. The effects of Contagion persist on a target until that target or Morena dies. Comparing her ability to a game app, she mentioned that Contagion will also end once the game is cleared . Morena believes her ability to be an advanced combination of the other Nen types. An example is the manipulative side of Contagion manifesting when someone cheats during the card game, or attempts to withdraw from it, forcing them to pick only between Yes or No. Due to its similarities with that of Prince Halkenburg's Guardian Spirit Beast, it is possible that her Nen ability is a symbiotic type ability, party form.", "Character_Name": "Morena Prudo"}

{"Name": "Skill Hunter", "Types": ["Specialization"], "Description": "Chrollo can steal the Nen abilities of others to use as his own through a conjured book known as Bandit's Secret. The victim, of course, no longer has access to the stolen ability. The theft happens under strict conditions: Chrollo must witness the Nen ability in action with his eyes. He must ask questions about Nen and be answered by the victim. His victim's palm must touch the handprint on the cover of Bandit's Secret. All of the above must be completed within one hour. To use a stolen ability, Chrollo first conjures Bandit's Secret and turns to the page of the desired ability. The book must then remain open in his right hand, allowing him to use only one ability at a time. The abilities are subjected not only to the limitations but also to the emotions and thinking of their creators. For example, despite seeing corpses as immobile masses no different from objects, Chrollo cannot use Order Stamp on them due to the opinion of the original owner. Additionally, an ability vanishes from the book if its former owner dies. However, if post-mortem Nen is involved, Chrollo can still utilize the ability. Expert Nen users can see through some of these conditions, as Zeno rightly guessed that Chrollo needed to fulfill four or five of them before he could steal an ability. Additionally, Bandit's Secret has the uncanny ability to upgrade itself. While the exact upgrade is unknown, it is most likely the removal of conditions or limitations, such as a condition to steal or the limit of needing the stolen individual alive. Chrollo mentions he needs to upgrade his ability to steal a specific Nen ability. During his call with Shalnark, Chrollo himself hinted that he might be able to return the Nen abilities he has stolen, but he has not shown what conditions must be met for that to happen.", "Character_Name": "Chrollo Lucilfer"}
{"Name": "Puppeteering", "Types": ["Manipulation"], "Description": "Neferpitou can attach a clownesque puppeteer to a target to exercise complete control over them. They can not only move it but also make it speak and even have it use Nen regardless of whether the owner of the body was a Nen user. The orders of each puppet are set by Neferpitou beforehand, so it is able to move automatically, but the Royal Guard can still reposition it as they please. The number of bodies Neferpitou can control at the same time is unknown, though it is known to be higher than 50. However, their puppets are of lower quality than Morel's. Neferpitou can perceive aura through their puppets and sense when they are disabled, which, combined with their En, allows them to monitor immense areas. The conditions for Neferpitou to attach the puppeteer are unknown. The first two times they used this ability, it was on corpses on which they had operated with Doctor Blythe. It's also known that the corpses controlled by Pitou don't decay; however, it's unknown whether that's because of the Puppeteer or result of a special surgery performed with Doctor Blythe. The senior officers Neferpitou controlled with their puppeteers collapsed when they were dispelled, possibly suggesting they can indeed be applied only to deceased individuals. Dispelling the puppeteers allows Neferpitou to recover the aura inside them. Since the soldiers controlled with this ability were often seen either making impressive jumps or hovering in the air, it is possible the puppeteer grants them this capacity, though it may also be simply due to the puppeteer dragging the controlled soldiers along as literal puppets on a string as it floats about. The puppeteers are invisible to non-users and Nen users in a state of Zetsu. The one controlling Kite was invisible even to Nen users before manipulating him into using Nen. It is unclear if this was because of In or that is simply a condition of the ability. In the latter case, this might mean that the puppeteer is conjured and that Neferpitou decreased risk and increased aura consumption to hide it from sight in certain circumstances.", "Character_Name": "Neferpitou"}

Even after Neferpitou's head was crushed, the ability remained active out of their loyalty to the King, becoming stronger after death and enabling them to sever Gon's arm. Overall, its effects seem to suggest that it might make use of Enhancement and Manipulation, with the ballerina being conjured or emitted if it is not a Specialization ability.", "Character_Name": "Neferpitou"}

By touching the intended target, he can mark them with a different symbol depending on which hand he used. When the two marks touch each other, they trigger an explosion. The marks can be created instantly, but to reach their full power, Chrollo needs to touch the target for three to five seconds. In the latter case, the explosion is powerful enough to kill people around the bearer of the marks, instead of just the bearer themselves. A symbol can be fully charged even after its application, by means of physical contact. Despite Chrollo saying that the marks themselves explode, the fully charged symbols were able to turn what they were affixed on into a bomb, including parts separated after the application of the symbols. The ability was stolen from the elder of Meteor City. Although he since died, his Nen became so powerful after his death that Chrollo was able to retain his ability. For the same reason, once the marks are affixed, they will remain until they explode, even if Chrollo's book is closed. Their power is such that they can even counter the restrictions of Skill Hunter, preventing a copy created with Gallery Fake from disappearing even after the ability is no longer in use if a mark has been affixed on it.

Removing the head of the puppet will deactivate the ability. The stamp has the kanji for person and leaves the same mark upon being affixed. The ability is capable of controlling a large number of puppets, but the orders cannot be too complex. Chrollo discovered that if he controls the copy of a person, giving commands that go against that person's beliefs can prove detrimental to the point that a command will sometimes be ignored. However, he discovered that using language that creates emotional distance\u2014such as saying break instead of kill\u2014can bypass the puppet's will.

If he touches a target with both hands, the two of them instantly switch forms. The ability only affects appearances, not abilities or personalities. Since the marks remain on Chrollo's hands, it is relatively simple to identify him, although clothing can be used to hide them. Nonetheless, it is an effective way to blend into a crowd. For the mark to appear on his right hand, which would otherwise be holding the book, Chrollo needs to use the bookmark, but after activating the ability, he can hold the book normally. It is one of the abilities that Chrollo stole to fight Hisoka. It is currently unknown what Nen type it uses.

Neon refused to read the fortunes she told, feeling that it would spoil her ability, but she was willing to listen to what Chrollo had to say about a portion of his fortune. Chrollo, however, was willing to discuss and analyze the fortunes he told in great detail. When Shizuku asked Chrollo to read her and Bonolenov's fortunes again, he told her that the ability disappeared from his book.

Shaiapouf was capable of creating more than 5,000 cocoons for the survivors of the selection, although he was originally expected to generate ten times as many, with the twofold purpose of increasing the quality of Meruem's food and creating a loyal army of Nen users. When used on humans, the cocoon has the additional effect of turning them into human-Chimera Ant hybrids, creating a whole new species. With Neferpitou's assistance, Palm was made into an experimental soldier with all her memories, but no emotions associated with them due to the emotional charge of recollections affecting the process of learning Nen in unpredictable ways.

{"Name": "Deep Purple", "Types": ["Emission", "Manipulation"], "Description": "This ability allows Morel to manipulate his smoke as he sees fit. With the aid of his giant pipe, he produces great amounts of smoke which he can then shape in countless constructs, such as ropes, grass, hoses, rafts, rabbits, Nen Beasts, and even replicas of individuals fully capable of speech and with remarkable strength and speed, although physical contact with them will expose the trick. Smoke constructs can also be told apart from living beings with En, although not with general aura sensing. Morel can change the color of the smoke to make the created objects seem more realistic, even using them to blend into his surroundings, as well as modify their durability to the point they can become virtually indestructible, a facet of his ability that may include the use of Transmutation. The versatility of Deep Purple is such that Morel boasted he had yet to meet a Nen user with a more flexible ability. His most complex creations are the Smoke Troopers. Morel can emit cores wherein he puts simple Manipulation commands, such as to attack defensively and retreat when encountered by an enemy, before covering the cores with smoke and mold them into his Troopers, which then start acting automatically. It is possible that the cores are not always required, as Morel was able to create Troopers directly from his exhaled smoke. In this case they seem to operate by taking direct orders from Morel rather than relying on preset commands. Alternatively, it is possible that Morel can form the cores remotely, at the same time as he shapes the smoke into constructs. Morel can create a maximum of 216 dolls. By sacrificing quantity to gain quality, he can compress that amount to 50. These dolls then become more complex than his regular dolls, and Neferpitou admitted their quality was superior to the one they controlled. Deep Purple caps Morel's aura output.

The name of the ability seems to imply that Tsubone can take seven different forms. Thus far, she has transformed into a motorcycle that, when ridden by two Nen users, can easily catch up to Killua while he uses Speed of Lightning, and a glider that can follow an airship above the cloud and shoot down aircraft with its missiles.

Removing the needles will cause him to revert to his original appearance. According to him, the transformation is quite painful. He can also change his appearance without needles, but in this case, he is able to maintain the disguise for around five hours, and his eyes remain the same. He can use this ability to infiltrate into places where his targets may reside, as shown when he fooled the Phantom Troupe into thinking he was Hisoka after switching places with him in the Phantom Troupe's hideout. This ability was also at one point used by Illumi on another person, warping the target's face while inducing incapacitating pain.", "Character_Name": "Illumi Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Blinky", "Types": ["Conjuration"], "Description": "Shizuku can conjure a vacuum cleaner Nen Beast she calls Blinky. It can inhale an infinite number of nonliving objects, but not anything that she considers living or that is made with Nen. The latter restriction enables her to spot traps. Only the last object to be vacuumed can be regurgitated, and Shizuku herself has no idea where the rest goes. Her ability is extolled as rare and valuable to the Troupe since it allows the Spiders to clean up the evidence of crime scenes . She can also use Blinky to remove foreign materials from living bodies. It appears that she has to say aloud what she wants to vacuum up. She does not always need direct contact for Blinky to inhale an object. In battle, Shizuku uses the vacuum as a club. Her most dangerous technique, however, involves exsanguinating her opponents by having Blinky suck up their blood from any open wounds.", "Character_Name": "Shizuku Murasaki"}
{"Name": "Spiritual Message", "Types": ["Manipulation", "Emission"], "Description": "Spiritual Message allows Shaiapouf to use his scales as a specialized En. Once they come in contact with someone's aura flow, they make it more distinct, allowing Shaiapouf to analyze the blend of 30 emotional patterns and, through them, formulate conjectures about the opponent's psychological state, personality and thoughts so that he can formulate strategies accordingly. His scales also have a hypnotic effect on those who breathe them. The hypnosis is potent enough to completely suppress the will of average humans, causing them to follow orders even if they lead their bodies to destruction. After his control terminated, 46,613 civilians died from bodily failure, which implies that he could control an even greater number. Shaiapouf cannot spread his scales against air currents. It is unknown if the scales are conjured or naturally produced by Shaiapouf's body, as well as whether the hypnotic state is chemically induced or achieved through Manipulation Nen.", "Character_Name": "Shaiapouf"}
{"Name": "Beelzebub", "Types": ["Manipulation"], "Description": "Shaiapouf's second ability allows him to break his body into multiple miniature segments of himself. He can vary the size of each body, down to nano-size at the smallest; the smaller they are, the more he can create. Segments smaller than flies, however, lose their sense of sight. Shaiapouf can control his segments telepathically with astounding accuracy through his core body, which can only be shrunk to about the size of a bee, sharing their perceptions.Beelzebub can be utilized to create thousands of small clones in order to escape confinement or spy on large areas undetected, or to form copies indistinguishable from the original in order to fight. However, said body-size clones are much weaker than the original, as is the hypnotic effect of their scales. All segments are also far less durable than the original: the small ones can be destroyed with weak physical attacks, while Killua was able to incinerate large parts of a body-size clone with his electricity. Since Shaiapouf has control over every single cell in his body, he can easily recreate his clones if they are broken with sheer force; however, if the cells themselves are damaged, for example by being burned, he is powerless to restore them, resulting in damage to his body when the ability is disengaged.", "Character_Name": "Shaiapouf"}

He can reconstruct his face, physique, and even his voice. This ability can also be used for healing purposes: by feeding someone else his cells, he can heal their injuries, even potentially lethal ones. However, it is unclear if it would work on someone without special assimilation abilities.", "Character_Name": "Shaiapouf"}
{"Name": "Autopilot Mode", "Types": ["Manipulation"], "Description": "By sticking an antenna into himself, Shalnark's body could go into autopilot mode and gain immense aura, resulting in a tremendous boost of speed and strength to dispatch any enemies within sight. Once Shalnark had entered the mode, he could not withdraw from it until the mission was completed. After leaving autopilot mode, Shalnark experienced intense muscle pain for multiple days and was completely unaware of what he had done. The ability had the additional benefit of preventing other Manipulators from controlling Shalnark, as it is impossible to gain control over a target that is already being manipulated. Aside from Manipulation, the increase in aura output and physical abilities might have involved Enhancement.", "Character_Name": "Shalnark"}

The barrier appears to be unbreakable both from the inside and the outside, as Menthuthuyoupi was unable to damage it with his regular attacks as well as his explosions.

{"Name": "Dance of the Serpent's Bite", "Types": ["Manipulation"], "Description": "The technique is initiated when Kalluto lifts his hand and drops a certain amount of paper confetti. By subsequently waving his fan through the air with graceful movements, he can lift them up and throw them at his opponent from multiple angles. If one sticks into his or her body, he can move his fan again to gather the remaining confetti and hurl them at the opponent again, amassing them in the shape of a swirling stream reminiscent of a serpent. Snaking through the air, the stream pierces into the body part where the confetti had previously stuck. If there are more than one, Kalluto can then gather the confetti again to repeat the attack. Using this ability multiple times, Kalluto was able to tear apart the body of a Chimera Ant without difficulty.", "Character_Name": "Kalluto Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Hypnotic Spell", "Types": ["Manipulation"], "Description": "By placing a needle into the target's brain, Illumi is able to condition them into following pre-set orders as long as the needle remains embedded. In Killua\u2019s case, the activation triggered a crushing fear, which he associated with Illumi, that in turn caused varying degrees of paralysis depending on the severity of his contravention. The conditioning activates automatically as soon as the victim intends to take an action that violates Illumi\u2019s orders. Willpower alone is not sufficient to break free from the hypnosis; however, through resisting it, the victim suffers headaches that grow increasingly localized, making it possible to detect the presence and position of the needle. The ability is also subtle, leading the victim to think that the commands they receive reflect their own emotions or are a result of their habits. Not even Biscuit Krueger, who trained Killua to help him overcome his fear, and Isaac Netero, who used to be revered as the best Nen user in the world, were seemingly able to detect the effects of the needle. It seems this ability can also be used to suppress specific feelings or memories until the needle is pulled out, as Killua attributed it to his having turned his back on his sister.", "Character_Name": "Illumi Zoldyck"}

The victims can perform complex actions, such as speaking and driving. They have no will or reflexes of their own, and can be made to take suicidal actions. Although some victims show evident signs of being controlled, others can fake normal behavior to deceive onlookers, which Illumi can facilitate by positioning the needles so that they are not immediately visible. This method of producing henchmen to do Illumi's bidding was implied to require more time than Needle People. Despite being dead, no victim of this ability appears to have suffered wounds apart from the insertion of the needles, possibly suggesting that is how they were killed.", "Character_Name": "Illumi Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Needle People", "Types": ["Manipulation"], "Description": "Illumi sticks a special needle imbued with a large amount of aura into the skull of a person and gives an order. The target of the ability loses all sentience and follows his order until they die trying or from overexertion. Should a Needle Person survive, they will be crippled for the rest of their life. Illumi generally sticks one needle in the back of the head of the target, whose ungainly movements and expression make them easy to recognize as being under the influence of the ability; however, Needle People who had two needles embedded into their forehead have been seen speaking and driving normally.", "Character_Name": "Illumi Zoldyck"}

The size of the fabric can change according to Owl's will. It also seems very durable, as it successfully enveloped a car in motion. Owl can then bring the object back to its original size by uncovering it. It appears that another cloth can be conjured while another is still in use, as Owl was able to capture the car the Phantom Troupe was in while he still had possession of the auction merchandise.", "Character_Name": "Owl"}
{"Name": "Little Flower", "Types": ["Unknown"], "Description": "Genthru gives his aura explosive properties, creating small yet deadly detonations in his palms. He employs this ability by grabbing hold of an opponent and triggering the explosion. If the ability is used on the opponent's face and they fail to guard properly, their mouth, nose and eyes will be irreparably blown away, while blasts close to the fingers will blow them off, and everywhere else will damage the muscles and nerves beneath the skin beyond recovery. Aside from combat, Genthru uses this ability as a deterrent to threaten other players or discourage them from trying to touch him. One of its weaknesses is that Genthru needs to shield his own hands with more aura than he uses to detonate, which renders Little Flower significantly less powerful than Countdown and makes it possible to guess when he is going for a fake-out by the use of Gyo at the moment of contact. To counter opponents with this ability, Genthru can release Little Flower through both hands; however, this comes at the cost of severely reducing the amount of aura with which he can guard the rest of his body, the proportions becoming 20% of his aura for each blast, 25% to shield each hand, and a mere 10% everywhere else. Due to its resemblance to other abilities based on forms of energy as well as the explosions capping Genthru's aura output, it seems likely that the ability belongs to the Transmutation category.", "Character_Name": "Genthru"}
{"Name": "Exorcism", "Types": ["Conjuration"], "Description": "Abengane's ability requires him to first burn a campfire. He takes a wooden effigy and chants a prayer to forest spirits. He takes a branch of leaves, weaves a netted decoration around the doll, and burns it in the fire. The campfire rages, amassing the aura of the flora and fauna of the forest alongside Abengane's own to conjure a Nen beast. The appearance and size of the construct depend upon the power of the curse to exorcise. The Nen beast is able to exorcise Nen curses by devouring them, though it will linger until the originator of the ability has died or Abengane satisfies the conditions to disarm the curse. However, Abengane is unable to lift Nen abilities left by the dead. Aside from Conjuration, the ability may also make use of Manipulation.", "Character_Name": "Abengane"}
{"Name": "Hakoware", "Types": ["Conjuration", "Emission", "Manipulation"], "Description": "Hakoware involves Knuckle conjuring an indestructible Nen Beast mascot called the Amortizing Power Redirector  onto the opponent after being dealt a blow from Knuckle, emitting his aura into his opponent. A.P.R. constantly lends Knuckle's aura to whomever it is attached to, displayed by a rising counter on its forehead. When adding interest, A.P.R. announces It's time, adding interest . As long as A.P.R. is attached, any attacks done to Knuckle by his opponent return aura to him, lowering the counter. Until all of the aura lent by Knuckle is returned to him, he cannot be physically damaged by his opponent. The reverse is also true: each of Knuckle's blows only lends more aura to his opponent, causing no damage. The stronger the attack, the more aura is lent or returned. In both cases, the person suffering the blow can still be knocked back by it, despite suffering no damage. The interest rate on A.P.R. is 10% of the borrowed aura, accrued every 10 seconds while the victim is within 50 meters of Knuckle. As the amount of borrowed aura accumulates, A.P.R. also grows in size. When the aura borrowed from Knuckle exceeds his opponent's total remaining aura , the opponent goes bankrupt. Thus, it is in Knuckle's interest that his opponent spends wastes as much aura as possible, as quickly as possible . The result is that the opponent's aura balance falls that much quicker until it is below the amount they owe Knuckle , at which point they can no longer possibly repay their debt, and bankruptcy sets in. Bankruptcy causes A.P.R. to transform into the Individual Ren Suppressor  , a demon-like mascot that follows the debtor for 30 days and forces them into a continuous state of Zetsu. It is worth noting that when Knuckle struck Shaiapouf's copy, A.P.R. was attached to the latter's real body rather than to his clone. Furthermore, Knuckle can use Hakoware on multiple targets at once, as well as track their general location at all times, regardless of the distance. The ability can be removed by an Exorcist, but it takes a great deal out of the Nen remover. It is also cancelled if Knuckle is rendered unconscious. It is unclear what Nen types are involved in the ability; A.P.R. might be conjured and rendered invisible to non-users, which would increase the aura cost, or emitted and possibly transmuted. Regardless, Manipulation would likely be required to endow the construct with sentience , while Emission might be involved in the process of lending aura to the opponent.", "Character_Name": "Knuckle Bine"}
{"Name": "Countdown", "Types": ["Conjuration", "Emission", "Manipulation"], "Description": "Genthru can attach a bomb to a victim by following two conditions, in no particular order: he must touch the target while saying the word Bomber and explain both of his abilities in full . A demonstration of the ability seems to count as explaining it, considering Genthru didn't need to explain how Little Flower worked both times he activated Countdown as the targets had already witnessed it. The bomb is then conjured and its countdown timer starts at 6000. The timers are linked to his victims' pulses, counting down faster if their heart rates increase. When it reaches 0, the target explodes from the inside, with the blast being ten times more powerful than that of Little Flower. In order to nullify this ability, the victim needs to touch Genthru and say, I caught the Bomber. Genthru can detonate the bombs at any time when touching thumbs together with Sub and Bara, with all three saying the word Release , Rir\u012bsu). Though he is a Conjurer, he also employs Emission and Manipulation to make this ability possible.", "Character_Name": "Genthru"}

The device or weapon can retain its original function and can be manipulated at will. The transformation can be partial and take effect a few seconds after contact. The transformative properties of this ability, as well as the fact that non-users can see its effects, seem to point to it falling in the Conjuration category, while Hinrigh's control over the animals might imply the involvement of Manipulation. Among the animals that Hinrigh can conjure there are snakes, pigeons, cats and oysters. Objects that Hinrigh transform with Biohazard revert to their original forms once the aura is used up. If the mass is too big or too small, the transformation is not as fuel-efficient.

{"Name": "Dowsing Chain", "Types": ["Conjuration"], "Description": "A chain ending with a small, ball-shaped weight that Kurapika frequently uses in combat, for offensive and defensive purposes. Its main utility is as a medium for pendulum dowsing, with the ball moving in accordance with Kurapika's dowsing objective at a given time. Hence useful for investigation, the chain can be used to determine the location of missing individuals and identify if someone is lying . If the chain's ability is used in a group, it works better if the persons questioned reply one at a time. Under ordinary conditions, Kurapika must be directly in front of the target for the lie detection to be effective; however, when Emperor Time is active, he can also use that ability through video recordings, provided he has met the subject before. Kurapika himself is unaware of how this side of his power works, his guess being that, through the conveyance of the chain and extreme focus, he can unconsciously detect subtle indications that someone is lying.", "Character_Name": "Kurapika"}

{"Name": "Dragon Head", "Types": ["Emission", "Transmutation"], "Description": "Zeno can transmute his aura into a tangible extension of the body in the form of a dragon, which he then hurls at the opponent as a straight shot. This ability is often used in conjunction with Emission, allowing Zeno to shoot the dragon as a projectile or use it as a means of transportation. The dragon can continue to exist for an unspecified amount of time even after being detached from his body, as demonstrated when he employed it to transport Netero and Meruem a considerable distance from the palace seemingly at tremendous speed. This was probably the ability that caused Neferpitou to grow excited when their En touched it. On that occasion, Zeno created a much bigger dragon than in his fight against Chrollo and flew with it while showing no visible strain. Dragon Head can also serve as a basis for other Nen abilities, such as Dragon Lance and Dragon Dive. Used in conjunction with the former, it can inflict light damage on a masterful Nen user such as Chrollo by merely brushing past him and keep him restrained between its jaws long enough for Zeno to close the gap between them.", "Character_Name": "Zeno Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Dragon Lance", "Types": ["Transmutation"], "Description": "This ability allows Zeno to control the dragon created with Dragon Head through precise motions of his hands, without emitting it. Due to its power and flexibility, it is perfect to attack while keeping the opponent at a safe distance. Zeno was able to make the dragon move quickly enough to prevent Chrollo from getting close to him, as well as to grip him the split second he was distracted by Silva. Since this ability essentially consists in Zeno extending his aura and altering its shape as well as properties without separating it from his body, Dragon Lance can be classified as a Transmutation ability.", "Character_Name": "Zeno Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Dragon Dive", "Types": ["Emission", "Transmutation"], "Description": "After getting above his target and using Dragon Head, Zeno shatters it in hundreds of smaller aura dragons that rain down from the sky. This technique can cover an area as vast as Ming Jol-ik\u2019s palace and everything else within the outer walls, with each shard being capable of piercing through several layers of concrete before dispersing.

{"Name": "Chain Jail", "Types": ["Conjuration"], "Description": "An extremely durable chain with a hook for an end piece, whose sole purpose is to capture Spiders and strip them of their freedom. It forces captives into a state of Zetsu, shutting off their aura and preventing the use of Nen abilities; consequently, it is only possible to escape from Chain Jail using brute force, although not even Uvogin, the physically strongest Spider, could break free from it. The chain's conjuration speed is such that Kurapika can fully restrain a distant target in half a second. To create Chain Jail, Kurapika imposed the Limitation that it may only be used on members of the Phantom Troupe, with the added stipulation that violating this rule will result in his death.", "Character_Name": "Kurapika"}
{"Name": "Emperor Time", "Types": ["Specialization"], "Description": "When Kurapika's eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency . Kurapika explains this using the terms Level, Force, and Accuracy: his Levels in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, but his Force and Accuracy for every category are raised to 100%. Thus, if Kurapika's Level in Conjuration was 10, his Level in Emission would remain 4 at the most, but his Force and Accuracy in any Emission ability would increase from 40% to 100%, making him evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter.

He is capable of issuing at least two commands per Stake of Retribution, can dispel the chain at will, and is confident that he would be alerted if a Spider removed it.

The user gains knowledge of anything the manipulated animal sees or hears. For this reason, the ability is particularly useful when utilized on flies or mosquitoes, but since they have many natural enemies, they often die while under the effect of the ability. Faster animals may be hard to catch. The ability cannot be used on living beings conjured via aura. The controlled animal maintains the user's capability of seeing aura. This ability seems to consume very little aura, as even someone who was originally not a Nen user could maintain it for one hour without visible strain.

It consists in turning his aura into microscopic particles akin to photons and either deploy them with his En in a flash or detach the photons from his body and spread them into the surrounding air. Each photon maintains his aura even if it is separated from Meruem's body. It also allows him to measure the shape, quality, emotion, and other informational content about the things the photons interact with; hence this ability most likely also entails Emission and Manipulation too. As stated by Welfin and Shaiapouf, he can detect everything, even lies. The precision of the information he can gather depends on the number of photons directed at the object of interest. It is also briefly shown that immediately after deploying the photons in a flash, Meruem can seemingly teleport to the close vicinity of any target of interest within the region affected.

Each portal is linked to a specific room, with the maximum number of entrances being dependent on the size of the room . Each room is completely separate from the others. Normally each entrance can only lead back to the portal Knov created for it; however, Knov can use a master key to connect any room exit to any previously set portal. Although the specifics are unclear, it appears that Knov can make his portals undetectable in some circumstances, as Flutter, a Nen user, was not able to locate them before or after use, and Knov could plant three inside the Royal Palace of East Gorteau without them ever being detected by the Royal Guards or Welfin, who traced back the Hunter's steps. Aside from infiltration, thanks to their imperceptibility, the portals can serve as trapdoors of sorts, transporting and trapping unsuspecting enemies into one of Knov's rooms.", "Character_Name": "Knov"}
{"Name": "Double Machine Gun", "Types": ["Emission"], "Description": "After separating his fingertips at the height of the distal phalanges, Franklin expels aura from his fingers in the form of bullets. Coupled with the ability's high rate of fire, their tremendous speed and power make it ideal to slaughter dozens of opponents in a matter of seconds. Tocino, a fellow Emitter, was astounded that Franklin's projectiles could tear through his Nen puppets and retain enough kinetic force to inflict fatal wounds. Although it was not required, Franklin chose to cut his fingertips off because he felt it would be more effective, and since self-imposed limitations can greatly enhance Nen abilities, the power of each bullet increased dramatically.", "Character_Name": "Franklin Bordeau"}
{"Name": "Nen Stitches", "Types": ["Transmutation"], "Description": "Machi transmutes her aura into threads to use in a variety of ways, such as manipulating her target's movements like a puppeteer, track targets, or set elaborate traps to capture, strangle, or cut enemies. Machi notes that the strength of the threads is inversely proportional to their length: a thread long enough to circle the globe would be as strong as cotton, but a thread less than one meter in length could lift a ton. The threads are also very durable, unable to be cut or torn. However, their strength is reduced significantly when the threads leave Machi's fingers. Another notable usage of her threads is to sew up wounds and even to completely reattach severed limbs in a short time. From what she said after reattaching Hisoka's arm and since he was able to move his fingers immediately after the operation, it is reasonable to assume that the stitches also have intense regenerative properties, either revitalizing the dead cells or stimulating the production of new ones.", "Character_Name": "Machi Komacine"}
{"Name": "Metamorphosis", "Types": ["Transmutation"], "Description": "Menthuthuyoupi's primary ability allows him to control any part of his anatomy freely. In battle, he most commonly uses it to sprout four additional arms and make all six tentacle-like, significantly increasing the range and number of his attacks every second. When he does so, he also produces additional eyes on his head, shoulders, and back in order to erase his blind spots and keep track of multiple enemies. He can turn the tip of each tentacle into a blade to inflict more localized damage. He can also give himself wings enlarge his arms to increase the power of his blows, and eject spikes from his torso to impale a nearby enemy. At the cost of expending a few instants to prepare the attack, he can also sprout countless spikes from his back that extend for several meters and can move so quickly that not even Shoot was able to dodge them while riding on top of one of his floating hands. They were also able to pierce it, despite his hands having previously withstood several of Menthuthuyoupi's lashes. He was also able to liquefy his cells in order to feed them to Meruem, and shapeshifted into a much smaller, winged form that allowed him to survive despite donating most of his body mass. He can transform extremely quickly.", "Character_Name": "Menthuthuyoupi"}
{"Name": "Hanzo Skill 4", "Types": ["Conjuration"], "Description": "Hanzo can project a double of himself which can phase through matter and hover in the air. His consciousness leaves his body while he uses this ability, which is put in a state similar to sleep. Talking to his body or touching it will cause the astral projection to be dispelled. Since the doppelganger requires his full focus, he can control it with extreme precision. With it, he was able to knock out a security guard and strangle a Nen user to death. It appears that he cannot rescind the technique himself if not by returning to his body. Although doubles are by definition conjured and manipulated, and in fact Hanzo considered using his own doppelganger to prove the existence of Nen to Vergei, Hanzo's double appears to flicker on occasion, which might suggest that it can transition between matter and aura; this, together with its ability to turn intangible, might mean that Emission is also involved in its creation.", "Character_Name": "Hanzo"}

{"Name": "Big Bang Impact", "Types": ["Enhancement"], "Description": "Uvogin's most powerful attack. He focuses all his aura into his fist and then uses Enhancement Nen to strengthen his Ko, which he then punches his target. The ability was described as a simple right straight boosted with aura. However, due to Uvogin's mastery of Enhancement and high physical strength, it generated enough force to cause an explosion rivaling the destructive power of a small missile. Uvogin's aim was to make it as strong as a nuclear warhead. In the fight against the Shadow Beasts, a single Big Bang Impact created a crater measuring several meters in diameter and obliterated part of Worm's body without direct contact. It also shattered Kurapika's arm even though the latter was using Emperor Time.", "Character_Name": "Uvogin"}
{"Name": "Bungee Gum", "Types": ["Transmutation"], "Description": "Hisoka's main ability allows him to make his aura sticky and elastic. Its extreme durability, flexibility, and adhesive properties make it an exceptionally versatile ability with several offensive, defensive, and supplementary applications. He can activate it from his fingers, hands, and feet. He can attach it both through physical contact and remotely, by extending it towards the target, which makes it very difficult to avoid. He can give it the command to contract at will, and it snaps back with greater force the more it is stretched. It is so resilient that it did not tear after absorbing the full force of a ball hurled by Gon with Rock, or several of Gotoh's coins, which makes it an effective way of returning projectiles to the sender.Offensively, Bungee Gum can be used to pull the opponent towards Hisoka or to create flail-like weapons. He can also separate it from his body, in which case it will tear after a maximum stretch of 10 meters. He most commonly detaches it from his body to attach projectiles to his opponent, such as his Shu-enhanced cards, while concealing it with In. The combination of the latter technique and Bungee Gum allows Hisoka to lay multi-layered traps that spring all at once, killing the unsuspecting opponent in a flash. He has also emitted it to restrain individuals as powerful as Machi.Bungee Gum also has a wide range of auxiliary applications. Hisoka can attach it to a solid surface to retreat at extreme speed when the need arises. By using it on his feet, he can adhere to the ground or run on walls. It is also useful for sticking objects in place for traps or to keep hold of them, even after throwing them. By covering a wound with it, he can instantly stop hemorrhages. On one occasion, he enveloped his lungs and heart with it so it would resuscitate him. By creating non-adhesive aura, he can also replace missing limbs, which can coil like a spring to propel himself at tremendous velocity.", "Character_Name": "Hisoka Morow"}

It can also burn off excess fat and cure arthritis, muscle tension and locked joints. It is particularly useful for training recovery purposes and to treat aging ailments. Although only one massage has been shown so far, there are many more according to Biscuit, some of which are cartilage massage, head massage, and roll massage. This ability is a mixture of Transmutation, Manipulation and, presumably, either Emission or Conjuration.", "Character_Name": "Biscuit Krueger"}
{"Name": "14 Devils", "Types": ["Emission", "Manipulation"], "Description": "Razor can create eight anthropomorphic Nen beasts, numbered from 0 to 7, which he calls devils. In his dodgeball game, seven of them act as his teammates and one as the referee. The devils are capable of redirecting his passes with such speed that Tsezguerra could not follow them, although the destructive power of the ball decreases with each pass. If two devils fuse together, the numbers on their bodies add up, creating a bulkier monster. Although the number of Nen beasts is reduced through this procedure, the resulting devil is physically stronger than any of the two from which it originated: No. 13, the fusion of No. 6 and No. 7, managed to catch Hisoka's throw, which no individual devil was able to achieve on its own, as well as to prevent him from retrieving the ball from its grasp. One of its throws also knocked out Goreinu despite the ball not being infused with aura. However, even No. 13 was pushed out of bounds when it tried to hold on to a ball punched by Gon with Rock.A side effect of the ability is that Razor is unable to draw out his full power while his aura is split among the Nen beasts; however, he can simply dispel the Nen beasts to recover it and utilize his full output. This faculty might suggest that like Morel Mackernasey's puppets, Razor's Nen beasts are created with Emission and possibly also Transmutation, as the Sea Hunter also has the ability to retrieve the aura he poured inside of them, although the possibility still exists that the devils are conjured.", "Character_Name": "Razor"}

His body is engorged and swells up as his rage increases until he unleashes it with an incredibly destructive explosion, capable of leaving a crater of a few dozen meters in diameter, before returning to its normal form. The blast results in great pleasure for Menthuthuyoupi, followed by empty despair. Menthuthuyoupi is left especially vulnerable as his body swells up. Still, through controlling his emotions, he can cancel the process and return to his usual bodily shape in an instant, allowing him to strike back after luring in the enemy. In his centaur-like form, he became able to channel the rage as a destructive beam. He never used this variation of the ability himself, which was showcased by Meruem instead.", "Character_Name": "Menthuthuyoupi"}

He appears to become faster in this state and retains the ability to shapeshift. As his wrath grows, instead of his whole body swelling up, only the amoebic sac on his left shoulder does, removing his previous weakness.", "Character_Name": "Menthuthuyoupi"}
{"Name": "Thunderbolt", "Types": ["Transmutation"], "Description": "Killua leaps into the air above the opponent and projects a bolt of lightning from his fingers, paralyzing them for a few moments and causing them pain. Although the ability was unable to inflict any visible damage to Rammot even before the latter learned Nen, it succeeded in stunning Menthuthuyoupi. On both occasions, Thunderbolt was utilized to allow an ally to strike the opponent while they were vulnerable.", "Character_Name": "Killua Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Whirlwind", "Types": ["Transmutation"], "Description": "The first core function of Godspeed has Killua react automatically to external stimuli. Instead of the normal process of the stimulus being perceived by the nerves, which transmit a signal to the brain which in turn sends an instruction to the muscles, Killua programs his aura to send an electric signal to his muscles so as to instantly react to a threat, bypassing the comparatively slow nervous system. The aura can be preprogrammed to respond to different stimuli: physical contact, malevolent intent in enemy aura, or someone stepping in a predetermined perimeter, and the specific response is preprogrammed as well.Concretely, this results in a drastic boost to Killua's reaction time, which has both offensive and defensive uses. When Killua used a prototype of this ability, he was able to grab a dart between the instant it was conjured, already in contact with his skin, and the moment it punctured it. Whirlwind is also effective as an offensive ability. If the opponent executes the action Killua has preprogrammed a response for, he will, in most cases, be able to land an attack before they can, thanks to both his reaction and his movement speed being drastically enhanced. When he used this application of Godspeed against Menthuthuyoupi, Killua was able to momentarily disappear from his sight, and struck him several times without the latter being able to do anything, the short lapse between the Royal Guard's aura surging and him taking any action being enough for Killua to preempt any move his adversary could make. Youpi himself admitted to being completely powerless throughout the beating. On that occasion, despite his attacks inflicting no damage at all, Killua's electricity proved powerful enough to elicit screams of pain out of Youpi, as well as to paralyze him for a few instants. When he later used the same ability against Shaiapouf's clone, which is considerably swift in its own right, Killua was able to dodge its attacks with Komugi on his back, leading Pouf to fear that even with all his cells, he would have a hard time catching him, and then burn off its cells by generating an electric current between his fingers whenever it stepped into a circle he had drawn. Since giving an order to one's aura is generally a Manipulation skill, it is possible, albeit unconfirmed, that Whirlwind makes use of this Nen category. Since Killua is using his aura to boost his reaction time, which is generally an Enhancement skill, it is hinted, albeit unconfirmed, that Whirlwind makes use of this Nen category.", "Character_Name": "Killua Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Speed of Lightning", "Types": ["Transmutation"], "Description": "The second application of Godspeed allows Killua to retain conscious control of his movements. His running speed and jumping ability increase dramatically, hence why he uses it primarily to cover long distances in a very short amount of time. As a consequence, this core function is more affected than Whirlwind by the terrain: Tsubone was able to keep Killua in sight while he was running through the woods, but was shaken off as soon as he reached a paved road. However, even at full throttle, he was severely outsped by Tsubone's motorcycle transformation while she had two riders. The butler estimated that by crossing the woods, it would take Killua 10 minutes to reach a destination about 40km away, whereas a car driver would take twice as long. This suggests that on unfavorable terrain, Killua's speed with Speed of Lightning is approximately 240km h . If he carries someone, they will suffer mild electric shocks as long as they are in contact with him. Since Killua is using his aura to allow himself to constantly move at full speed, which is generally an Enhancement skill, it is hinted.", "Character_Name": "Killua Zoldyck"}
{"Name": "Texture Surprise", "Types": ["Conjuration"], "Description": "Hisoka can apply his aura to any smooth, flat surface, such as paper or cloth, and manifest imagery on it to change its appearance and texture for deception. He can replicate over one thousand different textures. He has tricked Nen users of the Spiders' caliber with this ability, with none of them realizing he had used it, either by sight or by touch. Against Kastro, he utilized Texture Surprise to hide his wounds and confuse him. It can also be applied to pure aura, such as Hisoka's Bungee Gum, to alter his own appearance. Since no aura is detectable once Texture Surprise is active, whether through eyesight, touch, or extrasensorial perception, its effects are also visible to individuals unable to use Nen, it is safe to assume Texture Surprise is a Conjuration ability, which is further supported by its requiring Hisoka's direct action to be dispelled and by a verb used in its description.", "Character_Name": "Hisoka Morow"}

{"Name": "Coin Gatling", "Types": ["Enhancement", "Emission"], "Description": "He primarily uses his aura to turn coins into weapons, flipping and rapidly firing barrages from both hands simultaneously and with more power than real guns. When needed, Gotoh can also add a rifling effect to each of the coins to cause more damage to his opponent at the expense of losing some of the coins' traveling speed. The rifling is to such a degree that the coins would continue to spin and penetrate the target even if they're momentarily stopped by potent elastic and adhesive materials such as Hisoka's Bungee Gum. In the manga, the coins and his hands can be seen glowing with aura when he fires them, which may imply he is proficient at Shu, Emission, and or Enhancement, whereas in the anime, the coins do not appear to be infused with Nen, possibly suggesting he reinforces his fingers with the latter Nen type.", "Character_Name": "Gotoh"}
{"Name": "Rock", "Types": ["Enhancement"], "Description": "Rock is a close-ranged attack, and has the highest power out of Gon's three Jajanken attacks, owing to his natural affinity for Enhancement. To perform it, Gon focuses aura in his fist with Ko, chanting as he readies the attack. If he has time to build up his Ren, the punch will be even more powerful. Rock is stronger than a normal Ko punch. According to Knuckle, this is because Gon takes risks by charging the attack and lowering his defenses, which leads to his aura output being increased for the duration of the ability. Gon was able to knock out Knuckle with this attack, despite the latter using Ko to defend himself, and also to send Hollow flying off into the distance . When gathering all his anger at Neferpitou, Gon was able to summon such a great amount of aura that Morel, the target of the ability, broke out in a cold sweat, later causing Gon to apologize because he thought the attack could kill him.", "Character_Name": "Gon Freecss"}
{"Name": "100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva", "Types": ["Manipulation", "Emission", "Enhancement"], "Description": "Netero summons a multi-armed Nen construct behind himself which takes the form of a gigantic statue of Guanyin. To execute an attack, Netero clasps his hands together in a fluid motion, as if in prayer, after which one of the arms on the statue strikes down upon his target in conjunction with Netero's hand motion. The procedure is repeated before every attack. Due to Netero\u2019s immense speed, the whole process can be carried out in far less than 0.1 seconds, up to thousands of times per minute. A single palm strike from the bodhisattva was enough to push Neferpitou a considerable distance away without the Chimera Ant fully understanding what had happened. The sheer number of arms makes it so that the possible combinations are so numerous Meruem regarded them as being practically infinite, and it is only by detecting Netero's unconscious bias for one move over another that he managed to best the ability. Due to this its extreme speed and power, Zeno Zoldyck considers the 100-Type Guanyin Bodhisattva the chairman\u2019s most dangerous ability.It is unknown if the construct is conjured or emitted; it's likely that the statue is made using Emission type Nen and then strengthened using Enhancement Nen.

When residing inside a corpse, Ikalgo can use a special kind of giant fleas as rounds for the gun; they have a vertical leap of 200 meters , and their saliva contains anticoagulant properties so potent that not even Killua was immune to it. The flea bullets boast impressive range and muzzle velocity and are powerful enough to knock an unaware individual back a few meters, and since he's an Enhancer, Ikalgo likely enhances the bullet power. Furthermore, their trajectory did not appear to change in the slightest when Ikalgo was targeting Killua. However, they do not appear to be capable of killing the target directly, managing to draw blood but not proving lethal even when hitting a critical area such as the neck. This would be in line with Ikalgo's reluctance to kill. The fleas can be conjured only if Ikalgo is puppeteering a corpse; if he is not, he can conjure regular bullets.

A giveaway is the fact that when the clone appears, Kastro's presence seems to double literally. If the secret of his technique is puzzled out, Kastro can simply fight in tandem with it. Despite its power, however, the ability has some flaws, including the immense amount of focus it requires and Kastro's inability to replicate the effects of a battle, such as dust and blood, on his double, making the deceptive and trickery aspect of the ability ineffective in a drawn-out clash.

{"Name": "Limitation Transformation", "Types": ["Enhancement"], "Description": "By forming a Vow in a condition of immense emotional distress, Gon was able to summon all the power 'll ever have, growing to an age where he could defeat Neferpitou. His physical strength, Nen abilities, aura output and aura reserves increased immensely, to the point that the Royal Guard feared he might pose a threat to Meruem himself. Upon seeing him, Killua deduced it would normally take decades of training to reach that level of power. His heightened speed and reflexes allowed him to easily dodge Neferpitou's Terpsichora which pushed them beyond their limit. While in this state, Gon's single Ko kick was capable of throwing Neferpitou dozens of meters into the air, causing them to cough out blood, whereas they were left unscathed by Isaac Netero's attack. His first Jajanken blasted Neferpitou up the side of a hill and caused them to lose consciousness, although a few more were necessary to finally kill them.However, the price to pay was as great as the boost. Neferpitou guessed the ability had been possible only because an extraordinarily gifted individual willingly threw away his predisposition and compressed his life, predicting that Gon would never be able to utilize Nen again in the future. After the Royal Guard's death, Gon returned to his normal body and fell into a coma. His body soon started to decay, requiring constant life support, and he would have eventually died if not for Nanika's intervention. Despite making a full recovery, Gon remained unable to see and use aura. According to his father, he simply went back to normal, and should count himself lucky for getting off relatively scot-free. Going off Killua's fear that the more aura Gon used in that state, the harsher the backlash would be, it is possible that the transformation, on top of depriving Gon of the ability to use Nen, did not require his death per se, but that it shaved away a portion of his lifespan commensurate to the amount of power that Gon utilized while transformed. The repercussions are so severe that Illumi described Gon's Vow as being worse than death, and Killua was confident any Exorcist would die on the spot trying to dispel it. His belief proved founded when the Hunter Association's only official Exorcist confirmed there was nothing she could do.It is unknown what Nen types are involved in this ability. Bill's Erigeron similarly entails the stimulation of growth and the increase of aura reserves, so it might be possible to speculate that Gon's transformation is an extreme form of Enhancement.", "Character_Name": "Gon Freecss"}

This single attack injured Meruem more than the thousands of palm strikes that preceded it, although the damage was ultimately only superficial.
