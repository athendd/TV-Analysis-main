        "Hunter Exam arc": "Kurapika makes his first appearance onboard a ship that goes from Whale Island to a testing site of the 287th Hunter Exam. He, Gon, and Leorio are the only 3 candidates unaffected by a storm the night before. When the Captain announces an even fiercer one is approaching, the three are the only candidates not to leave the boat. He initially refuses to answer the Captain's question about his motives, but when he reveals that he is an examiner Kurapika replies that he is the last of the Kurta and wants to capture the Phantom Troupe. When Leorio objects he does not need to become a Hunter to do so, Kurapika condescendingly explains a license facilitates the acquisition of information. When Leorio answers the Captain that he is attracted by the material possessions provided by being a Hunter, Kurapika remarks that money cannot buy class. The two quarrel over their different opinions and decide to end it with a fight out on the deck while another storm is raging. When they are about to start, a crew member is knocked off the deck by a piece of wood broken off from a yard. Leorio immediately rushes to help him, followed shortly by Kurapika, but they fail to catch him. Gon jumps overboard and grabs him, while the two catch him by his legs. They both reprimand Gon for his recklessness, then apologize to and makeup with each other. Seeing that, the captain laughs and decides to take the trio to the port nearest the exam hall, Zaban City's. Once they dock, the Captain tells Gon to head for a lone tree up a hill, and Gon decides to follow his advice instead of taking the bus to Zaban City. Kurapika decides to follow him, interested in what he may do. Leorio later rejoins them after learning the bus doesn't head to Zaban City. In what seems an abandoned town, Kurapika and Gon hear people around them. An old lady, also an examiner, told them they have to answer a riddle that they have only 5 seconds time limit. While Kurapika and Leorio scuffle over the prospect of one causing the other to fail, another applicant takes the test in their place. Upon hearing the riddle, a deeply stunned Kurapika thinks of it's subjectivity, making it absolutely impossible to give a correct answer. While Leorio protests the impossibility of the riddle, Kurapika hears the applicant the lay let pass scream and understands how to pass the test, but the screener silences him and, after Kurapika agrees to it, poses them her question. Getting annoyed, Leorio picks up a wooden stick and attacks her but is blocked by Kurapika, who explains to him that they have passed because keeping silent is the correct answer to this question. The old lady then tells them to go to a house in the forest to find a couple, who will be their navigators if they consider the trio qualified. Kurapika and Leorio laugh at Gon when he states he cannot find an answer to the question, but become pensive when he suggests they might one day be faced with a similar choice. The three then take the path opened by the screener. Four hours later, upon entering the house, they see a wounded man lying on the floor and a woman being held captive by a Kiriko. The monster flees as soon as it sees them. Telling Leorio to take care of the husband, Kurapika and Gon chase after it, and Kurapika is impressed by Gon's vision in the darkness, and shocked by his ignorance about Magical Beasts. Gon clubs the creature and forces it to let go of the wife. Kurapika catches her and notices the strange tattoos on her hands and face. Leorio then shows up and says that there is nothing to worry about the husband. Kurapika hits him in the face with his wooden sword. It turns out this Leorio is a Kiriko in disguise, but Kurapika claims he did not know, and that he hit him because he thought he left an injured. After the monster runs away, he asks the wife who she really is, ready for combat. After Gon is able to tell the two nearly identical Kiriko apart, they reveal to be the Navigators and that the couple they \"saved\" are their two children. The daughter states that Kurapika passed the test thanks to his vast knowledge and deduction skills, which allowed him to recognize the chastity symbols on her body and understand that she could not have a husband. Meanwhile, Gon is able to tell 2 identical-looking Kirikos apart, which greatly surprises them. The 2 Kirikos and the husband and wife, who are actually their son and daughter, then explain to the trio how they have qualified for the next testâ€”Kurapika for his vast knowledge on ancient symbols, Leorio for his good medical skill and confidence, and Gon for his extraordinary movement and observation. The Kiriko fly all three of them to the exam hall. When they arrive in Zaban City one of the Kiriko takes them to the secret entrance of the exam hall. Kurapika and Leorio start a debate over why one would become a Hunter, with Kurapika stressing the nobility of securing order, and they both ask Gon what being a Hunter means to him. Before he can reply, they reach the site of the first test, a large tunnel, Kurapika, Leorio, and Gon to see a lot of experts. Tonpa, nicknamed Rookie Crusher, offers each of them a can of his laxative-spiked drink but Kurapika pours it on the floor after Gon claims that it has a bad taste. An examiner, Satotz, then appears and tells the candidates to follow him through the tunnel. He runs faster and faster but Kurapika has little problem keeping up with him. While running, he reveals to Leorio the story about the stolen Scarlet Eyes of his people and his determination to retrieve them and capture the Phantom Troupe. The marathon finally ends when they reach the Milsy Wetlands, also known as the Swindler's Swamp. Satotz warns them of the dangers and tells them to follow him through the swamp in another marathon. On the way, Kurapika, Leorio, and a number of other candidates are attacked by Hisoka, a man notorious for his bloodthirstiness. All of them are killed in a short time, except for him, Leorio, and Cherry, examinee #76. Knowing that they have no chance of winning against Hisoka, they split up in 3 different directions. After a while, Kurapika returns and sees Gon kneeling there with a shocked expression on his face. While running together to the site of the Second Phase, the Visca Forest Preserve, Gon tells him about what happened to him and Leorio. At the site of the Second Phase, two Gourmet Hunters, Menchi and Buhara, appear. The Second Phase starts with Buhara asking them to cook roast pork. Even though the kind of pig that they need to catch, the Great Stamp, is the most dangerous pig in the world. Kurapika, his 3 friends, and many other contestants have little difficulties passing the test after they discover that these pigs have a spot of weakness on their foreheads. The next test has however proven to be a real problem as the other examiner Menchi asks them to make sushi. Despite having read some books about this dish and his careful analysis of the hints that Hanzo, a contestant from the country of sushi, and Menchi unintentionally gave away, Kurapika still failed like the rest. When the Second Phase is on the verge of having no qualifier, Chairman Netero of the Hunter Association arrives in an airship, criticizes Menchi for losing her temper as an examiner, and tells her to give them another test, which she herself also has to take. This time around Menchi asks them to cook boiled Spider Eagle eggs, which hang from strong strings connecting the two sides of deep ravines. Even though they have to jump into a ravine to find the egg, Kurapika and 41 other examinees pass the test and are subsequently taken to the site of the Third Phase in the Chairman's airship. The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam starts atop the Trick Tower, which has numerous passages, and they have seventy-two hours to get to the bottom of it alive. Kurapika, Leorio, Killua, and Gon are forced to form a team of 5 with Tonpa to pass through the 1st door. They advance, using the majority rule several times on the way, and their road leads them to a platform set up in the middle of a bottomless abyss where they have to participate in a best-of-five series consisting of 5 no-hold-barred one on one matches against a team of 5 long-term prisoners. Tonpa is the first to fight and he deliberately forfeits the match to undermine his teammates. Gon's match is the second, and thanks to his quick thinking he manages a win to level the score at 1 - 1. The 3rd match is Kurapika's and his opponent is Majtani, an impostor with a spider tattoo on his back who brags about his fake Phantom Troupe membership to Kurapika. Enraged, his eyes turn scarlet and he knocks Majtani down with a single punch, however, the match is still going on because he refuses to kill his opponent, who seems to be unconscious. Seeing that, Leorio steps in makes a bet that Majtani is still alive, and pretends to drop him into the abyss. Majtani is so scared that he stops playing possum and admits defeat. The score is now 2 - 1 in favor of Kurapika's team but they have lost 40 hours due to betting. Leorio's own match is the 4th, and he loses it after a rock-paper-scissors game along with a bet of ten hours on the gender of his opponent, Leroute. With the score being 2 - 2, Killua quickly kills his opponent, Johness the Dissector, in the last match, putting it at 3 - 2 in their favor, but Kurapika's team now have less than 10 hours to reach the bottom. As they advance, they have to use the majority rule some more times and face many other obstacles such as electric quizzes, a multiple-choice labyrinth, mine camps, \"Go\", etc. Thanks to a brilliant idea of Gon's in choosing ways, they manage to reach the bottom of the tower with just thirty seconds left, thus qualifying them for the Fourth Phase. During the Fourth Phase, the remaining examinees are taken to Zevil Island to take part in a 7-day manhunt among themselves to capture each other's number badges. Kurapika's designed target is Tonpa, who in turn has Leorio as his target. After Leorio is tricked by Tonpa and Sommy and loses his badge, Kurapika appears, knocks Tonpa down, and asks Leorio to team up with him, to which Leorio agrees. They take the badges #16 and #118 from Tonpa and Sommy. Even though Kurapika already has six points from his own and Tonpa's badges, he still helps Leorio find his target Ponzu, examinee #246. As they are looking for the target, they again encounter Hisoka, who tells them to give him their badges if they want to live. Kurapika says that he will give him the badge #118 which only means 1 point to them, as for the other 3 badges, they will fight with their lives to protect them. Hisoka agrees, lets them go, and takes the badge #118. At the end of the sixth day, he and Leorio meet Gon and tell Gon about Ponzu. Gon helps them find her by tracking the smell of the medicine that she uses to defend herself. Finally, they find Ponzu, but together with her they are trapped in a cave full of snakes whose owner Bourbon, examinee #103, is already dead due to anaphylactic shock caused by her bees. Thanks to Gon's bravery and ability to hold his breath for an extended period of time, all of them are able to get out of this situation by using a soporific gas of Ponzu's to make the snakes sleep. Before they go, Gon takes the badge #246 from a sleeping Ponzu and leaves her the badge #103. With this, Kurapika and his 2 friends qualify for the next and also the last phase. The Final Phase of the Hunter Exam is an elimination tournament with a twistâ€”the winner of a match will be removed from the list and receive his very own Hunter License and the loser will be given more chances, depending on their placement in the bracket. Kurapika's first fight is against Hisoka. After fighting for a while, Hisoka whispers something to him and quits the match, allowing him to become a licensed Hunter. When Illumi Zoldyck wants to go murder Gon, Kurapika, Leorio, Hanzo, and some examiners block his way. Later, he also requests that the Hunter Association examine the nature of Killua's act of murder against another contestant, Bodoro, during the Final Phase and has a brief argument with Pokkle, who wins by default thanks to Killua's disqualification, but they make up with each other after the exam has ended. He then decides to go with Gon and Leorio to Kukuroo Mountain to rescue Killua from the control of his family. Kurapika, Leorio, and Gon arrive at the entrance of the Zoldyck Estate, the Testing Gate, on Kukuroo Mountain on a tour bus. They tell the old gatekeeper, Zebro, that they are Killua's friends but he says he can not let them enter until they can at least push open the first testing door which weighs four tons, because going into the estate via any other way will result in them getting killed by the huge guard dog named Mike. The trio then accepts Zebro's invitation to stay in his house to train, using his heavy equipment. After 20 days, they are all able to open a testing door and head for the Zoldyck Residence without any problem until they are stopped at another gate by a female attendant named Canary. She beats Gon up to prevent them from advancing but thanks to Gon's insistence, she becomes more and more reluctant to block their path and finally asks them to save Killua. Kikyo Zoldyck then appears with her son Kalluto, knocks Canary unconscious, and tells them to leave. Shortly after she and Kalluto leave, Canary regains consciousness and says she is going to lead them to the attendants' room. While staying in the servants' room, they are forced into playing a guessing game with some butlers of the family, which they manage to win. Killua at last arrives and leaves the Zoldyck Estate with them. Kurapika then tells his three friends what Hisoka whispered to him during the Final Phase. He would wait for Kurapika in Yorknew City, where the largest auction in the world takes place, on September 1st to tell him some interesting things about the Phantom Troupe. It is 6 months until that day so Kurapika says goodbye to his friends, after telling them that he is going to look for some work as a Hunter and arranges to meet up with them later in Yorknew City in September.",
        "Heavens Arena arc": "At some point after parting company with his friends, Kurapika succeeds in finding an agency specializing in providing rich and famous people with bodyguards and hirelings. However, he is immediately told that despite his Hunter License, he is not qualified for such work. The agent says that his Hunter Exam is not finished. During Gon and Killua's training in the Heavens Arena, it is revealed by Wing that Kurapika learned Nen after the Hunter Exam.",
        "Yorknew City arc": "Kurapika learns Nen in six months and looks for a customer who has strong connections with the auction in Yorknew City. At the beginning of August, he appears at the mansion of a collector who collects body parts to apply for a job as a bodyguard. In the mansion he meets five other people, three of them Hunters themselves: Melody, Baise, Shachmono Tocino, Basho, and Squala. A man shows up on the screen in the hall where they are waiting and tells them that if they want the job, they at least have to get out of the mansion alive. As he finishes, a group of 11 people who wear black hooded robes and masks and are armed with guns and swords suddenly appear and attack them. Using his Dowsing Chain, Kurapika blocks a number of bullets fired at him and jumps onto a chandelier to avoid the sword users and observe the situation. Noticing that Tocino is the only person who is not being attacked, he jumps down, puts a knife at Tocino's throat, and orders him to stop the attackers in three seconds. Tocino obeys by making the Eleven Black Children disappear and tells them that he is a Hunter ordered by the owner of the mansion to test them and that they can get out of the mansion now. Kurapika suspects that he is trying to confuse them. Using his Dowsing Chain again, he discovers that Squala is another infiltrator, which is further confirmed by Melody's, Baise's, and Basho's techniques. He and 3 other genuine applicants thus pass the test. After each of them completes another mission of finding a rare body part, they are all officially hired by the man who was on the screen previously, Dalzollene. Kurapika and the company's first task is to guard their boss on a journey to Yorknew City, where they will be participating in the Mafia Community's Underground Auction. The boss turns out to be Neon Nostrade, the daughter of the Nostrade Clan's leader. Neon, besides being spoiled, is also a Specialist whose abilityâ€”Lovely Ghostwriterâ€”allows her to make accurate predictions about the future. Her father has been using her ability to gain high status within the Mafia, hence the need for a large number of bodyguards. They arrive in Yorknew City on September 1st and on the night of that day the Underground Auction is attacked by the Phantom Troupe, who want to steal all the auction items. Some of Kurapika's comrades and many clients from the Mafia are slaughtered by the Troupe. However, having been warned about a possible attack via Neon's predictions, one of the Shadow Beasts, a group of the best ten Nen users within the Mafia, has already removed all the items from the vault. Believing that the Phantom Troupe has stolen them, the Mafia organizations in Yorknew City give chase, and Kurapika is instructed to join in. The Phantom Troupe decide to confront the Mafia, in the hope of luring out the Shadow Beasts to question them about the auction items. One member of the Troupe, Uvogin, is an extremely strong Enhancer. He single-handedly massacres a large number of armed Mafia gangsters. This has the intended effect, as four of the Shadow Beasts appear and attack him. Even though they manage to injure and paralyze Uvogin, they are ultimately killed by him. Seeing the spider tattoo on Uvogin's back, Kurapika flies into a rage. Despite his comrades' discouragement, he goes forward, takes advantage of the situation to capture Uvogin using his Chain Jail then leaves on a car with his comrades. The Troupe immediately chase after them, but their pursuit is halted by the arrival of the rest of the Shadow Beasts. On killing most of the Shadow Beasts, the Phantom Troupe manage to find out the Owl is the one with the auction items. Back at their headquarters, Dalzollene tries to torture Uvogin to force information about the items from him. Despite being impervious to these attempts thanks to his strong Enhancement aura, Uvogin reveals that the Shadow Beasts took the items away. He also suggests that, since the Spiders could not steal anything, if they are to release him immediately, he will spare their lives. Kurapika questions Uvogin about his comrades. On hearing that they were killed according to the Spider's plan, Kurapika hits him in a rage, managing to damage his nose and lips slightly. After Kurapika has left to meet up with Hisoka, Dalzollene calls members of the Mafia in to take Uvogin in custody. Shortly afterward, the Phantom Troupe arrive, dressed as Mafia members. They kill Dalzollene, cure Uvogin's paralysis, and free him. His furious shout upon release is heard by Melody, allowing Kurapika's teammates time to escape. Finding no one, Uvogin swears to hunt down the chain user, Kurapika. Meanwhile, at the pre-arranged rendezvous Kurapika meets up with Hisoka, who tells him about his secret purpose of joining the Phantom Troupe and offers to team up with him. Kurapika tells Hisoka to meet again the next day, September 3rd, at the same time. Meeting up with Melody and the rest later, he suggests that they get Neon to contact her father and ask for his advice. Light Nostrade promotes Kurapika to team leader, and makes arrangements to meet them later. Meanwhile, Uvogin has managed to track them down. Kurapika stays behind to confront him. After agreeing to go to a place far from the city where they can fight freely, Uvogin and Kurapika face off in a Nen battle. He manages to capture Uvogin and deprive him of his Nen. After questioning him fruitlessly, he is forced to kill Uvogin. Kurapika's defeat of Uvogin makes him the main target of the Phantom Troupe, who begin to actively search for him. On September 3rd, they catch Gon and Killua. One of them, Pakunoda, has the ability of mind-reading through touching. Since neither Gon nor Killua knows the \"chain guy\" is Kurapika, Pakunoda assumes that they have nothing to do with him. Shortly afterward, Killua realizes that Kurapika is the one the Troupe are searching for, but luckily he and Gon manage to escape at night, before being questioned by her again. Just before Gon and Killua are captured, Kurapika meets with Light Nostrade. He learns that the Ten Mafia Dons have hired a group of professional assassins to eliminate the Phantom Troupe and that Light wants him to join the assassination team. After meeting up with the assassins in the auction building on the night of September 3rd, he is told that Neon has slipped away from her guards to attend the rescheduled auction herself. Using his Nen ability, he manages to find her whereabouts. The auction building is once again attacked by the Troupe in revenge for Uvogin, and most of the hired assassins and 2,000 Mafia gangsters protecting it are killed quickly. Two elite assassins, Zeno and Silva Zoldyck, however almost succeed in killing the Troupe's leader, Chrollo, but just before they can finish the job, Illumi Zoldyck calls and tells them the Ten Dons have been assassinated in a mission whose client is Chrollo. The Zoldycks thus spare his life and leave. Then, using the ability of a member, Kortopi, the Phantom Troupe fake their own deaths, create copies of all the items and continue the auction using the fakes. Kurapika arrives just in time to see the fake corpses, he watches with hatred and sadness to the bodies of Chrollo, Machi, Feitan, Shizuku, Shalnark, and Franklin. He then wins the last item: a pair of fake Scarlet Eyes. The next day, September 4th, Kurapika meets up with Gon, Killua, and Leorio again. He tells them about the secrets of his Nen abilities and his connection with Hisoka, knowing that they are true friends. Now that Gon and Killua have learned of his abilities, they realize the threat Pakunoda poses. He then receives a message from Hisoka saying that the bodies are fakes. Kurapika decides to keep chasing after the Phantom Troupe alone, but Leorio, Killua, and Gon want to help him. While following the Phantom Troupe, Kurapika prepares to fight with Chrollo, Machi, and Shizuku, but Gon intervenes, causing his and Killua's capture. Pakunoda questions them again and finds out who Kurapika is. With the help of Leorio and Melody; Kurapika manages to capture Chrollo Lucilfer before Pakunoda could reveal what she has found out, Kurapika then contacts the Spiders, speaking with Pakunoda, Nobunaga and briefly Phinks about the terms of their exchange. When Pakunoda comes with Gon and Killua to meet him for a hostage exchange, Kurapika uses his Judgment Chain to forbid Chrollo from using Nen or communicating with the other Phantom Troupe members, and also to forbid Pakunoda from revealing what she knows about him. After the exchange, Kurapika collapses from exhaustion due to his continual use of his Scarlet Eyes. Once he recovers, he leaves Yorknew City to continue his search for the Scarlet Eyes.",
        "Greed Island arc": "After Killua returns to Greed Island, he informs Kurapika of the possibility that the Judgment Chain on Chrollo was removed. However, Kurapika assures Killua that it is still staying in Chrollo's body. After that, he has a short conversation with Light Nostrade, who is in a state of great confusion due to the loss of his daughter's prophetic ability.",
        "13th Hunter Chairman Election arc": "Kurapika is one of the absentees during the first four rounds of the election, despite the reappearances of his comrades under Light Nostrade such as Melody, Basho, and Linssen. He has not visited the hospital where Gon is being given intensive-care treatment and is not available on the phone either, which makes Leorio wonder, what he may be doing. After the events regarding the election and Gon's recovery, Leorio tries to call him again. Kurapika is seen in a church, making a funeral for his murdered comrades, ignoring all incoming calls. He managed to find several of their stolen Scarlet Eyes, looking more than ever determined to avenge them.",
        "Succession Contest arc": "After Leorio agrees to fill one of the two empty spots in the Zodiacs, he nominates Kurapika for the remaining spot. Mizaistom approaches Kurapika to request that he join the Zodiacs and accompany them to the Dark Continent. Initially, Kurapika's underlings within the Nostrade Family receive Mizaistom instead of Kurapika, but after Mizaistom restrains them, an annoyed Kurapika steps out to meet him. Mizaistom introduces himself and explains why he came, but is refused by Kurapika. Mizaistom decides to take a different approach and asks Kurapika about his progress retrieving the Scarlet Eyes. Kurapika's eyes turn red and he warns Mizaistom to speak wisely. Mizaistom reveals that while doing a background check for a VIP for the Dark Continent trip, he coincidentally identified the owner of a large number of Scarlet Eyes seen in a video uploaded to a darknet site six months ago, and offers to identify them for Kurapika if he joins the Zodiacs and accompany them to the Dark Continent, though he would have to spend about two months on a ship. Kurapika asks if the person would be on board, but Mizaistom remains silent as Kurapika still had not agreed to join him. After a moment of contemplation, Kurapika remembers that his priority is to recover his brethren's stolen eyes by any means necessary, and agrees to Mizaistom's requests. After hearing Kurapika's agreement, Mizaistom holds out a picture and identifies the owner as Tserriednich Hui Guo Rou, 4th Prince of the Kakin Empire. Kurapika takes a moment while holding Tserriednich's picture and sits in front of a monument, where he keeps the Scarlet Eyes he had managed to recover. He reminisces about his journey so far and thinks of the backgrounds of the people he had threatened, coaxed, and paid off to recover the Eyes. He thinks of Pairo, his now-deceased childhood friend, about the prospect of his journey finally beginning, after he reclaims the last of the Eyes, and wondering what to do after, without home to return to or anyone to welcome him home. Kurapika then takes a car with Mizaistom to the Hunter Association's headquarters and calls Leorio to update him on the matter. Leorio repeatedly demands to know his e-mail address, but Kurapika declines each time and changes the topic to ask about Gon. Leorio reassures him that Gon is fine and asks him to come over and help him through the awkwardness of not knowing anyone. Kurapika hangs up while thinking that Leorio doesn't actually have a problem, since he's not bashful. Mizaistom tells Kurapika that Leorio seems to have a lot of faith in him, but Kurapika expresses his uncertainty at his ability being useful in the endeavor, before thanking Mizaistom for letting him know about Tserriednich. Kurapika says he will help as much as he can and prepares to remind Mizaistom about his priorities, but is cut off by Mizaistom who had guessed his thoughts and preemptively told Kurapika that he could prioritize Tserriednich while on board. Mizaistom warns him that dark rumors surround Tserriednich and that he should be careful and aim for an amicable solution. Kurapika smiles faintly and tells Mizaistom that he is better at handling monsters in human skin than the unknown. As they ride, Mizaistom asks Kurapika what he will do with Tserriednich after recovering the Eyes. Kurapika explains that he will yield to most demands and just wants his brethren back. Mizaistom then asks what he would do if Tserriednich resists, and Kurapika sinisterly shares his experience with two others who had said they would rather die than surrender the Eyes, but changed their minds without dying, and shares his expectation that the same would happen with Tserriednich. Mizaistom hopes that that would be the case. Leorio meets Kurapika as he arrives and quietly shares that the mission sounded tougher than expected, before asking Kurapika for his opinion. Kurapika says that he had not heard much but did not believe it to be a problem. Cheadle interrupts them and leads them to a meeting room, where the rest of the Zodiacs wait. Cheadle introduces them to the other Zodiacs and begins her briefing about The V5 and the results of their past failures at exploring the Dark Continent, at the hands of creatures individually a greater threat than the Chimera Ants. She also mentions that they would need to discuss about how they would deal with the currently-detained Beyond, and asks if they have any questions. Kurapika raises a hand and asks how many allies Beyond has within the Association, surprising the other zodiacs with his directness. Kanzai asks how knows of this, and Kurapika snidely explains that it could be inferred from Netero's will hinting at Beyond making preparations for the journey until his father's death, and Beyond turning himself as a sign of his confidence in controlling a project of that scale even under confinement, requiring the existence of a trustworthy and competent right-hand man. Cheadle explains the events of the election to Kurapika, who has new questions and is asked by Mizaistom to speak privately with him outside. Mizaistom reveals to Kurapika that he and Cheadle have already begun an internal investigation about the matter and that they reached the same conclusionâ€”that the Zodiacs have a spy among them; and since no one has direct connections to Beyond, all Zodiacs are considered suspects. Mizaistom elaborates that Netero had appointed Pariston as the Vice-Chairman for fun despite objections, though adds that Pariston might be a red herring and not the real spy. He admits to Kurapika that part of the reason he was invited to the Zodiacs was that he is an outsider, and therefore likely unrelated. Kurapika agrees to Mizaistom's request to keep their suspicion of a mole within the Zodiacs a secret, and they return. Kurapika later apologizes to the rest of the Zodiacs for making accusations without having a grasp on the complicated situation within the Association and states that he is willing to use his connections with outlaws to offer information about Beyond and Kakin that government sources could never provide. Cheadle later assigns him to the Information Team with Mizaistom, Pyon, and Saccho in preparation for the voyage to the Dark Continent. One month later, as the 289th Hunter Exam comes to an end, Pariston informs Ging that his replacement seems to be quite competent, having failed all of Beyond's assassins. Muherr mentions that everyone who could have passed the lie detector test was failed by this guy, and that he might've known about Beyond's escape plan if they had been told the details. Pariston dismisses the possibility since they did not yet have an escape plan. In a flashback, Kurapika watches the candidates attempt the final test of the 289th Hunter Exam, a recording of their answers to a set of questions about the voyage's announcement, using his Dowsing Chain to identify those hiding information. While listening to their Q&A session, he passes one applicant and disqualifies two others: the first for hiding important information, and the second, Muherr, for mixing lies with some truth. Kurapika states his surprise at the number of spies having passed the the psychological test in the first round, and clearing the thermography and lie detector. Next to him, Mizaistom states how impressed he is with Kurapika's ability. Kurapika suggests not overestimating it since the ability's mechanism is still unclear to him. and offers his own interpretation; he can unconsciously perceive minute changes in the target that would otherwise go unnoticed by using the chain as a medium, but normally he would need to be directly in front of the subject. Emperor Time is able to circumvent this by letting Dowsing Chain work through a video recording provided he's met the subject beforehand. Kurapika then explains that the ability can only see through trained liars, meaning that if a spy wanted to hide any clues to his identity, he could have somebody erase or alter his memories; that way, since the target does not know he is lying, the chain would most likely stay still. While Mizaistom mulls this over, Kurapika inquires whether there is anyone in the higher ranks of the Hunter Association capable of doing so: if they were on the enemyâ€™s side, they could easily pass all the tests. After some reflection, Mizaistom concludes it impossible, saying that there should not be anyone in the Zodiacs with the ability in question, before explaining why he cannot be completely sure. The Zodiacs used to be aligned by their political orientation, often working with members of the same faction for their missions, discounting Cheadle, Botobai, and Ginta from Mizaistom's suspicions. Furthermore, the Zodiacs agreed to share information on their abilities to promote cooperation between them in light of their new specialized groupings for the Dark Continent voyage. Kurapika asks if he will have to do the same and hears Mizaistom reassure him of the opposite, that he would not press for any details or divulge whatever he hears regarding his ability, but in return would not be able to share the others' abilities with him. Kurapika is relieved and shares that he had been thinking how much of a help Leorio had been as a go-between. Mizaistom concurs. Mizaistom resumes his speculation and summarizes that, to their current knowledge, none of the Zodiacs can alter memories, and they probably don't know anyone who can do it, since he had examined the detailed history of all the past hunts for all members. Kurapika objects that a person with that ability could have been given top-secret missions or worked outside the Association, but according to Mizaistom the results of the Hunter Exam rule out this possibility, since a mole of that caliber within the Association would have taken measures to ensure certain people would not have failed. Mizaistom acknowledges the possibility of some being used as decoys to distract from more powerful spies, but shares that his greatest worry is Paristonâ€™s quiet and quick departure after the election, as only the existence of an ally on the Zodiacs' side would justify it. Kurapika then activates Emperor Time, offering his help to test the members in secret. As the Zodiacs share information about their abilities, Kurapika watches them through a video camera. He passes Kanzai and three others. Immediately after, his Dowsing Chain starts to swing, indicating that Saiyu is the informant. Afterward, Kurapika and Mizaistom watch the recording of the latter's conversation with Beyond. While Beyond was eating, Mizaistom announced the departure date is on August 8th, 35 days from then. King Nasubi Hui Guo Rou had petitioned directly to V5 for Beyond to attend the eve festival and the departure ceremony, as it would pain him for his benefactor to miss this historical event. Mizaistom promises Beyond he will be free to go to the ceremony, provided he reveals which of the Zodiacs is on his side. After a moment of silence, Beyond stated that Mizaistom is wrong on two things: he knows nothing about any spy, and he doesn't care about any ceremonies. All he knows is that he will have to eat and sleep in that cell for a month, and then wait two more months for the Black Whale to reach the New Continent. Until then, he will behave in Hui Guo Rou's sake even though he'd like to decline all ceremonies, seeing that his true goal lies after the voyage. But since he is still considered a hero and a pioneer who will lead the way to the new world, and that honor is important to Kakin, Beyond is sure they will pressure V5 anyway, and in that case, the Zodiacs themselves will be begging him to attend. At the end of the recording, Kurapika states that Beyond has been telling the truth. Mizaistom concludes that Pariston is the mastermind conspired with Saiyu, and the one plotting to free Beyond. Kurapika suggests they leave Beyond alone until landing since he's not hiding any ulterior motives. Mizaistom remains skeptical as Pariston and Saiyu might still encourage him even if Beyond didn't plan to escape before landing. Kurapika explains why it is unlikely: Beyondâ€™s contract with Kakin includes taking civilians to the \"New Continent\" as he wishes to highlight Hui Guo Rouâ€™s achievement, so he wonâ€™t be causing any problems en route. And in the worst-case scenario of him escaping, V5 might turn the ship around, even if it means breaking ties with Kakin. All of which contradicts Beyond's initial decision of announcing a truce and letting himself be captured. Consequently, it would be unwise for them to do anything about Saiyu in the meantime. Mizaistom agrees, but says he'd rather avoid sitting idly while Pariston and his spy are plotting. Kurapika is then given permission to watch the part of the recording where Saiyu explains about his Nen ability . He concludes that Saiyu was much more stable during his explanation, contrary to his proclaimed worry. On the reverse side, the remaining Zodiacs were obviously nervous about the risk of the spy learning about their abilities, yet still desiring to trust the others, which in turn affected their body language; all stereotypical behavior of the innocent. Kurapika surmises that Saiyu was telling the truth about his ability, and he is also on Beyond's side. He then proposes keeping tabs on Saiyu in secret to uncover his plans while gathering evidence. Mizaistom agrees it is safer than tailing him at all times, even if it means leaving him free to act. Kurapika states that knowing Saiyu's ability enables them to narrow down possible escape plans. However, if they were to restrain him too soon, Pariston may arrange something else. Kurapika expects them to escape right after the festival on the New Continent. Therefore, the best course of action would be to arrest Saiyu right before landing without Beyond noticing, ideally with some kind of proof to support their claim. In the off-chance of failing to do so, Mizaistom will have to admit he acted on his own in league with the newcomer, much to Kurapika's dismay. Mizaistom confirms his suspicions, stating he will also be criticized after speaking of resolve when in reality he has been working behind their backs to identify the culprit. Some of the Zodiacs might even change their approach to the mission if they find out that Mizaistom's means were based on a farce. Later, Kurapika answers a phone call from Linssen, who tells him that six of Kakin princes are hiring bodyguards to \"eliminate risk factors\" aboard the ship. None of their identities are shown, only each prince's respective salary. Kurapika hires Izunavi, Hanzo, Basho, Melody, and Biscuit Kruegerâ€”whom was recommended to him by Killuaâ€”so that the six of them can apply to all offers, and he can get closer to his main target, Prince Tserriednich. After a brief clash with Biscuit, he remembers Killua's advice and pacifies her with flattering. Looking at the six offers, he tries to deduce which of the anonymous employers could be Prince Halkenburg, who appears to have a close relationship with Tserriednich. In hopes of finding his client, he singles out two offers that state the prince will personally conduct the interview, as it shows signs of maturity and confidence. One has the highest pay as a result of the one-upping competition, and the other's pay never changed. Kurapika surmises Halkenburg is most likely the latter as it signifies his strong self-esteem and self-control. He sends his request and heads to a hotel managed by Hui Guo Rou, where he is surprised to discover that his employer is, in fact, Queen Oito, mother of Fourteenth Prince Woble. The Queen reveals the reason it was decided the offers had to be anonymous was to fend off assassins from infiltrating the popular princes' security. Halkenburg figured this much and did not put up a post. On the other hand, Queen Oito is looking for guards that would try to contact Halkenburg, seeing most of them are either assassins or fake followers, which would simplify a give-and-take relationship. The assassins will get to wait for their chance while protecting them, and the followers plotting to manipulate Halkenburg can learn his weaknesses. Queen Oito explains that pro guards only specialize in protecting dignitaries, and are not trained in proactively killing someone before she reveals the Black Whale voyage will turn into a war due to the rules of Kakin's succession as enforced by Nasubi. When Prince Halkenburg becomes the next King, and if this succession battle becomes public, he will be the one to suffer the most damage. For that reason, she hopes to buy hers and Woble's safety by blackmailing Halkenburg with his participation. She tells Kurapika if he accepts the job, she will give ten times the promised pay provided he can get them off the ship alive. And if he leaves now, he'll still be paid the promised fee if he keeps this conversation confidential. Kurapika agrees to protect her, so far as his terms are respected. Oito agrees and tells him about the gap in status between higher and lower wives. After reminiscing about her past life, she lets Kurapika hold her daughter. Sometime later, Kurapika boards the ship with Oito and Woble. He repeats the security measures before thinking to himself that the battle strength of his side is weak, especially since some Hunters may be spies. He has a phone conversation with Mizaistom, during which the latter informs him of the conditions of the three lower decks, leading Kurapika to think the meeting of the Zodiacs will be called off. He warns Oito that if something unexpected happens, they may be able to flee to the lower decks, escaping the succession war. While he contacts the system control room, he is startled by aura radiating off Woble's cradle. One of Oito's bodyguards is found dead in a toilet, all blood drained out of him. Kurapika inspects the body and concludes the culprit may have used Nen; however, the bodyguards who are not Hunters have never heard of it, while the Hunters do not say anything. He later confronts them about their silence, causing them to reply they are surprised he disclosed the information. From their conversation, Kurapika gleans he is the only one who knows about the succession war, meaning Pariston may be unaware of it as well. When the corpses of four more bodyguards are found, Kurapika conjures his Dowsing Chain, and, pointing a gun at his colleagues, states he will shoot them if they lie. The assistants and Hunters are revealed to be innocent, but the other two guards admit each of them is working for a higher ranking queen. They are tied to chairs before they continue their confession. From what they say, Kurapika infers Woble has received a Nen ability, which is probably triggered by her self-defense instinct. Kurapika deduces Woble sensed Woody's malice and killed him. However, he has trouble accepting Woble could have learned Nen in one month, but Bill tells him it would be possible with parasitic type Nen. At that point, the Nen beasts of multiple princes swarm into the room. Kurapika quickly contacts Melody and Biscuit. The latter tells him that there were Nen beasts in their quarters, but only the Hunters were able to see them, leading her to believe it is a parasitic type ability. Kurapika has Bill tell him everything he knows about that type of Nen and later accepts to reveal his agenda to improve cooperation. When Sayird stabs Kurton and the two restrained bodyguards to death, Kurapika prepares to fight him to take him alive. Kurapika manages to subdue Sayird and asks Bill if he's one of the important people mentioned. Bill claims that Kurton was more important due to his transformation skills. So Kurapika then tries to interrogate Sayird on his Nen type and ability, but to no avail. Although Bill first is against such a personal question, Kurapika convinces him due to the situation at hand and he reveals Sayird's Nen type and a brief explanation of his Nen ability. In a flashback Kurapika has, Izunavi advises him to focus on co-operation with allies. Back in the present Kurapika uses his index finger's ability to steal Sayird's Nen ability, while forcing him to go into a state similar to Zetsu. With Sayird's power stolen and aura drained the Nen beast that was manipulating him escapes, while Kurapika summons a Nen dolphin that equips the power and gives a little more detailed explanation of Sayird's Nen ability. No longer of use and to use less energy, the Stealth Dolphin is put on stand by. Regaining consciousness and now restrained, Sayird explains what happened to him and, before being taken away by the Kakin Empire army for questioning, explains his Nen ability in greater detail to Kurapika. With only Kurapika and Bill left to protect Prince Woble, Kurapika inquires what options they now have, now that Kurton is dead. Bill expounds that they have to either ask Pariston Hill or, harder still, Beyond Netero to leave the Black Whale. After listening to the rest of his explanation concerning parasitic type Nen, Kurapika concludes the real battle will start once all princes are back from the ceremony. The two review their options, with Kurapika refusing to use Sayird's ability due to the lack of information on the other princes. When Vincent arrives, he immediately kills one of Oito's attendants with the excuse of acting in self-defense, which leads Kurapika to realize he's not there as a spy, but as an assassin. Kurapika considers attacking Vincent, but quickly gives up when he surmises even an act of self-defense would be held against him due to Prince Benjamin's influence. He raises his hands and declares Vincent is the biggest threat to Woble's life. The hitman replies by asking him to \"cooperate\", by which he implies he wants the two Hunters' help in murdering Oito and Woble, leading Kurapika to insult him mentally. Removing his contact lenses, he turns to the queen and asks her if she trusts him. When Woble reaches her hands towards him, Oito declares she has the utmost faith in him. Kurapika then stabs her with Steal Chain, transferring Little Eye to her. As Bill attacks Vincent, Kurapika steals the latter's ability and restrains his hand. He accuses Vincent of wanting to kill Woble, which Vincent denies, but Oito promises she'll testify against him. Noticing his earpiece, Kurapika states he has an ability that can force him to tell the truth. Defeated, Vincent commits suicide by drinking poison hidden in one of his back teeth. Kurapika calmly states it could not be avoided and points the earpiece to an agitated Bill, crushing it only after giving anyone who might be overhearing misleading information. Kurapika wonders if he should wait until the next banquet and have Oito use Little Eye on Prince Marayam's hamster, but due to the backlash of Emperor Time, he quickly realizes it is an impossible plan. Thus, he explains Little Eye to the queen and instructs her to use it on a fly or mosquito. He then declines the dolphin-like construct, which asks him if it should equip Vincent's ability. He orders Bill to search the room and Shimano to answer the phone. The maid informs him there are three princes wishing to speak to him: Prince Benjamin, Prince Zhang Lei, and Prince Tubeppa. Since speaking with any of them first would be interpreted as an act of disrespect towards the others, who'd also believe him to be allied with the first prince he spoke to, and not replying would be a declaration of war, Kurapika reflects on his next move, while Benjamin's new envoy arrives. Confident that Benjamin believes him to be a Manipulator, he decides to speak to him and asks Bill to keep watch on Babimyna with Gyo, but he is surprised when he discovers Shimano has connected him with Zhang Lei. At the prince's request, Kurapika explains he decided to answer him because he would be the most open to discussion, but refuses to disclose any more particulars as they are likely to be related to the reason he was called: Nen. After Oito and Woble are allowed to come along, Kurapika accepts to meet the prince in 15 minutes. He finds out Benjamin has hung up, but Tubeppa is still waiting. Her guard Maor offers to exchange information regarding Nen beasts. When the bodyguard declares he is about to come over, Kurapika replies they have a private soldier of the first prince in front of their door, and letting Maor in but not to him may have consequences. They agree to meet in one hour. Kurapika then interrogates Shimano about her disobedience. Finding her explanationâ€”Zhang Lei being likely more open to discussion than Benjamin, whose soldier they have killed and who was unlikely to be on the phone himselfâ€”convincing, he consults her about the best course of action to take with Babimyna, to which she replies they have to let him or they will be detained by the army, which would allow Benjamin to kill Oito and Woble. With newfound respect for her, Kurapika contacts Benjamin's private soldier and informs him they are going to meet Zhang Lei. Babimyna resolves to wait in the room together with Bill. Kurapika, Oito, and Woble thus reach Zhang Lei, who offers them bottles of water to drink. Kurapika immediately begins his explanation, which is partially directed at Oito, who is able to see Zhang Lei's Sacred Beast. Declaring the next piece of information could potentially affect the outcome of the succession war, he asks Zhang Lei if he intends to continue their conversation with the bodyguards Coventoba and Slakka who are spies sent by other Queens and Princes in the room. The Prince pretends not to mind, but points out Kurapika likely has an appointment with either Tubeppa or Benjamin afterward, and gives Oito two of his own bodyguards Sakata and Hashito. Under Queen Unma's orders, Slakka goes with them too. On the intercom, Kurapika quickly checks on Bill and, after entering, updates him. With the number of enemies in their midst, Kurapika starts to get nervous due to Emperor Time's lifespan-shaving condition, since he cannot have Oito use Sayird's ability. In order to have Shimano and Bill search the room for bugs, Kurapika proposes the other bodyguards and Bill follows him in the bedroom. This results in a brief argument with Babimyna, which is won by Kurapika when he states he's doing it for the queen's peace of mind, as people were killed in the hall. Kurapika begins his explanation about Nen and the Guardian Spirit Beast protecting the princes, but is shocked to spot a cockroach on the ceiling. As he wonders what to do with it, Oito orders the bodyguards to catch it, feigning disgust. Kurapika summons Bill and Shimano and orders the former to catch it with Nen, allegedly in order to prove the truthfulness of what he told the guards. Bill and Oito understand his plan, which leads to its success: while Bill pretends to send out his aura, the queen utilizes Little Eye through Kurapika's dolphin construct. Kurapika then resumes his lecture, asking Babimyna for confirmation. He then proposes to teach Nen to all bodyguards within two weeks, stating the princes will decide if they should participate or not. To himself, he notes Babimyna's refined En and speculates the soldier already knows that it was Oito who gained control of the roach. An hour later, Kurapika sees Oito turn the page of her notebook, from which he infers she finished investigating the first prince. However, he worries about his remaining stamina, as his eyes have been scarlet for about 3 hours. The queen suddenly screams that Momoze is being murdered in the next room. To save appearances in front of Babimyna, Kurapika pretends she only had a nightmare, but she knocks his hand away and insists on checking. Kurapika tasks Bill with it. As the prince's corpse is taken away from her room, Kurapika reflects the accident is worrying, as the timing seems suspect. Sakata interrupts his musings by demanding to know why Momoze's beast failed to protect her. Kurapika replies her unusual sleeping pattern may be related, and that both things were probably consequences of the said beast being one of the two that attacked the other bodyguards. Despite acknowledging her mental state, Kurapika reasons he has to ask the queen to keep using Little Eye. When Babimyna asks Oito why she screamed, Kurapika realizes he knew about the queen all along and is surprised when he withdraws with the other guards and removes his En. Oito agrees to keep spying on the Princes, but specifies she is doing it for her daughter and not Kurapika. As she takes notes, Bill informs Kurapika some princes have already accepted his offer, but there are two problems. The first is the number of bodyguards, and Kurapika suggests they limit them to two per prince. Due to the fatigue caused by his Scarlet Eyes, Kurapika passes out before he can hear the second. 9 hours later, he regains consciousness. Bill, who hid his fainting fit from the other bodyguards, tells him Oito passed out when he did. Kurapika grows horrified at the thought that Emperor Time has remained active for that long and questions its limit. He then asks the queen to resume her surveillance from the 4th Prince instead of the 12th. Oito becomes suspicious of his motives, but Kurapika explains that is the best move, as the first prince and probably the second have Nen users among their guards, and they are allies with the third, while they know nothing about the third. Kurapika then kneels in front of her, swearing again her and Woble's lives are his priority. When Woble reaches for him, he lets her touch his fingers. Oito thus agrees but, mere moments later, she screams in terror. Kurapika passes her shout off as a nightmare to dismiss the guards who came running, and she tells him that a woman, whom Kurapika speculates to be Tserriednich's Spirit Guardian Beast, killed the cockroach. Kurapika's ability is thus dispelled, but the fatigue caused by the prolonged use of his Scarlet Eyes does not decrease. When Oito asks him to teach her Nen, Kurapika apologizes, as lending her a Nen ability had the side effect of opening her aura nodes. Not much later, at 9 a.m., the lessons begin. After all the participants have gathered around him, Kurapika, with his back to Oito's quarters, draws a line on the ground with white adhesive tape, demanding that no one cross it, lest they be forced to leave or he'll use force without warning. Myuhan immediately steps on it, causing Kurapika to ask his name and affiliation. Dropping the tape, he states that will be Myuhan's final warning. Myuhan pretends not to have noticed and apologizes, but threatens Kurapika and indirectly asks him if he is simply planning on stalling them. The Hunter promises once again they will all learn Nen in two weeks. He then retorts that if all Myuhan can do is speak in a provocative manner, it says a lot about his prince, causing the guard to lose his cool. Kurapika immediately draws his gun, but Danjin holds back his fellow bodyguard and apologizes on their behalf. Kurapika suggests everyone state their name and affiliation. He subsequently repeats the purpose of the meetings, ensuring that even though there will be differences in individual proficiency, everyone will learn Nen in the promised time. To make the lessons go smoothly, he asks if anyone can already use Nen. Belerainte and Furykov raise their hands, and Kurapika nominates them, supervisors. An unknown Nen ability suddenly attacks and kills Barrigen, with Sakata shooting the white snakes that crawl out of his clothes. Kurapika notices Zhang Lei's guards use 9mm bullets, which are hard to defend against even with Gyo, thinking he should also expect .45 caliber and HK handguns. He quickly deduces the attacker is not a Guardian Spirit Beast, but an assassin in their midst. He forbids his students from using firearms no matter the circumstances. He gives everyone 15 minutes to decide if they want to continue and heads to Oito's room. He uses his Dowsing Chain to ask Bill and Shimano if they are the users of Silent Majority, earning a negative response in both cases. He explains to her that due to the usage of Conjuration in the ability, it cannot be Woble's Guardian Spirit Beast, which leads him to speculate that, due to the complex system of Vows and Limitations that must be in place, it is possible that if one prince dropped out of the succession war, all Nen beasts would disappear. When he goes back to the hall, nobody has withdrawn. He begins his lesson and has Belerainte and Furykov check on everyone's aura flow. Kurapika confronts Shedule and Yuhirai about their copious aura output, unattainable for a real beginner. For safety and secrecy reasons, he agrees to speak with one of them at the end of the lecture. Sakata insists on participating, using his superior experience and the deal with Prince Zhang Lei as leverage. Kurapika is reluctant, but Yuhirai gives his consent, stating Prince Halkenburg would do anything to put a stop to the succession war. Yuhirai explains about his strange mark, which Kurapika suspects to be the work of a soliciting-type Manipulation ability. The two convene it is related to the prince's Nen beast and that it serves as a symbol of unity, expressing a contradiction inside Halkenburg: he wants to put an end to the monarchy, and the fastest way would be to win the succession contest, but he refuses to participate; however, his Guardian Spirit Beast wants to fight. Kurapika tests Yuhirai, determining he has not fully awakened to Nen and warns him that if Halkenburg really wants everyone to be the same, the Limitations that are probably in place risk being severe and affecting everyone who bears his mark. He manages to convince him Queen Oito wants to escape the contest too, adding that the lower princes must band together or they'll be killed off one by one. He then resolves to contact each of them via the Hunter Association. Kurapika returns to Room 1014. Unable to return to his real body, Hanzo enlists his help. Due to clearance issues, Kurapika replies the most can do is ask Halkenburg's guards to contact Room 1013 for him, but he will be able to do so only the following day. Shimano informs Kurapika that the Captain of the Guards of Prince Marayam is on the phone and would like to speak to him. Kurapika attempts to convince Vergei the room he is in has been isolated due to a Nen ability, but the bodyguard ignores him and requests that he investigate about the identity of Momoze's killer. When Kurapika reveals he already knows who the culprit is, Vergei initially pretends to be accommodating, accepting to open the door to a Hunter Association member in exchange for the information, but then asserts that he is not convinced by the rumors spreading about Nen, which seem too convenient for the Hunters. Still hoping to form an alliance, Kurapika tells him that the killer was Tuffdy and how he carried out the murder. Vergei states that Kurapika's explanation has only strengthened his belief that the Hunter Association intends to weaken Kakin from the inside and hangs up. Kurapika relays his impressions to Hanzo and asks him to stay in Room 1013. He warns the ninja that Vergei might suspect the presence of a mole in their midst since he did not inquire about his sources. When Hanzo asks him what he ought to do next, Kurapika tells him to prioritize finding information on how to ensure Prince Marayam's safety. When Hanzo leaves, with Babimyna's consent, Kurapika answers Sakata's questions about Room 1013, adding that he suspects the Nen beast of the Thirteenth Prince to be involved. Meanwhile, he wonders about Babimyna's conduct. At 10:00 a.m. of the following day the lessons resume, but Myuhan is killed by Silent Majority as soon as he steps into the toilet. While giving dispositions to everyone else in the room, Kurapika surmises the user can see and control the snakes from afar, which likely makes them a Manipulator. Satobi and Maor accuse Kurapika's faction of being responsible for the attacks and of using the lectures as bait. The Rat acknowledges that the circumstantial evidence might be enough to indict all of them, which could result in Oito and Woble being imprisoned separately. Belerainte comes to Kurapika's aid and insists that if the lectures stop, the real culprit will get away and everyone will lose their chance to study the other princes' defenses. Kurapika asks to speak to the Hunter in private and thanks him. Belerainte requests to talk to Bill for 10 minutes, so as to make his report to Room 1013 without seeming to talk to himself. Over the next few days, the lectures continue without the user of Silent Majority making another move. On Friday, he feels an incredibly powerful aura, but he resolves to keep his calm so as not to weaken his own Nen. The morning after the banquet, during one of the lectures, Kurapika and Bill feel the rumbling aura surge again. They conclude it comes from an odd-numbered room. Kurapika assures Sakata that its signature is different from the one of Prince Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast and that therefore it is unlikely that it belongs to him. From the way it swells before disappearing abruptly, Kurapika estimates that it is an Emission ability, which might be able to go through walls. Sakata then says that Kurapika's students are starting to have doubts about the training due to repeating the same exercise over and over. Kurapika replies that he will start the next stage the following day and performs the Water Divination test as a Specialist in front of them. After explaining its purpose, he points Ladiolus as his most advanced disciple to provoke some of the other bodyguards into being competitive. He states that one's Nen category should never be revealed and that the screenings will be conducted in a separate room and witnessed only by Bill and him. When Maor, Satobi, and Danjin object, Kurapika justifies his decision with the requirements of the training, the risk he took by showing his own Nen type, and his camp's wish for a stalemate, which means that he has no intention of gathering intelligence to hurt the higher-ranked princes. Once again, he adds that if they cannot accept his conditions, they can drop off the training. One by one, Kurapika invites Ladiolus, Maor, Yuri, and Satobi into the main bedroom. There, contrary to what he told them, he does not have them perform Water Divination, but, after receiving their consent, he forces their Aura Nodes open with Stealth Dolphin and briefly gives them Bill's Erigeron ability. He then enforces a gag order preventing anyone from disclosing what transpired until every one of his students has, supposedly, taken the test, lest the training be canceled. When the lesson ends, he thanks Bill for revealing his ability and, when the latter calls himself a coward for choosing Room 1014 to guard because he believed he could avoid major fights and for resolving to stay out of shame, Kurapika points out that cowards do not steel themselves as he did. Hashito approaches him, demanding to be taught Nen right away in return for allowing Tenftory to be awakened last. Kurapika accepts, but warns Hashito that, since he has not taken the training, he will be too exhausted to even move for a while afterward. At 11:30 of the tenth day the rumbling aura can be felt again. Kurapika observes that the intervals between one surge and the next are becoming shorter. During their conversation after observing 11th Prince Fugetsu's rapidly deteriorating state, Melody pleads with Kaiser to be released on bail to find out what happened to Fugetsu. Kaiser is forced to refuse her, citing an inability to refuse any orders to perform they wish to avoid. Melody asks him to instead visit Kurapika in Room 1014 and tell him everything, since Kurapika is the only one she trusts. Kaiser wonders if she really means everything, and Melody stresses that they can't waste any time, asking him to hurry. At 11:45 a.m. during lessons on the tenth day of the voyage, Kurapika and Bill invite Longhi into Room 1014's master bedroom in order to privately initiate her with Nen, as they did with her unawakened classmates. Kurapika lets Longhi enter first and joins her and Bill at a table after shutting the door, facing Longhi with Oito and Woble behind him. Before Kurapika and Bill can begin, Longhi declines the divination and volunteers that she can already use Nen. Kurapika and Bill are surprised and begin to react to her statement. Longhi activates her Moonlight Act to establish a Nen-based contract, simultaneously proving she was not the killer of Barrigen and Myuhan. Longhi explains that Moonlight Act allows her to loan her ability or to restrict the actions of those that voluntarily sign a limited-term contract of hers, and asks Kurapika to hold off on agreeing or disagreeing to an alliance with Tubeppa in the contract before she finishes explaining her terms. Longhi reveals that Tubeppa is unaware of her ability, and unaware of her ability to use Nen in general. She explains that her contract is insurance to guarantee that her true plan goes smoothly. Kurapika activates his Dowsing Chain and aims a gun at her, preparing to shoot her if she lies. Longhi asks why he bothers, pointing out that a Nen user cannot be killed with a .22 caliber handgun, but Kurapika does not respond. Longhi continues by sharing that her ability requires her to explain the whole truth first, and that telling Kurapika the details of a contract between him and Tubeppa would suffice if that were her only goal, but reveals that for her true plan, she wants to grant Kurapika additional power with her ability and has to explain everything about the true plan in order to do so. Longhi reveals that she is Beyond Netero's daughter, and pauses to let the weight of her words sink in. After a short pause, Kurapika asks her to contine. Longhi reveals that she, like many others, were raised to parents in a marriage arranged by Beyond, and put in the Royal Military Academy. She explains that she had thought her purpose was to be someone that Beyond placed in important positions close to the next king of Kakin. Longhi confirms Kurapika's understanding that what she had just explained was what she originally believed was her true plan. Kurapika watches intently as Longhi continues to explain what she earlier believed was Beyond's plan. Longhi mentions that she could use Nen as an infant as a side effect of Beyond's Nen attack, and that newborns with Nen instinctively learnt Ten and Zetsu to prevent fatigue. Kurapika asks her to elaborate what she means by attack, and Longhi reveals a mark below her tongue for Kurapika to see using Gyo, the mark of a curse that many of her half-siblings had, varying in strength between the half-siblings, which she believed was meant to curse a prince upon her death. Bill reminds Kurapika that taking too long would draw the suspicion of others, but Kurapika insists on hearing all of the story so that they can form a contract with Tubeppa. Kurapika confirms with Longhi that she is sure that her target is a Prince, despite not knowing who it is. After she confirms it, Kurapika agrees with Bill's speculation that Beyond left it to fate to increase its power using Nen limitations. Kurapika adds on that Beyond is in Kakin's innermost circles and so likely just wants Benjamin to take the throne. He points out that sacrificing a life is necessary for a powerful curse and that if Beyond gave Benjamin such a hint to ensure his survival, Benjamin could use his special martial law as a last resort. Longhi disagrees with Kurapika's reasoning, surprising him. Longhi expresses her belief that Beyond would not expend the effort he did for someone unrelated to him. Kurapika catches on to what she says. Longhi sees him understand, and explicitly states her belief that Beyond had fathered one of Kakin's 14 Princes. Kurapika asks Oito what the requirements for a Prince's participation in the contest are, and Oito replies that there was no mention of paternal lineage in the requirements. A knock comes on the door, and Sakata asks Kurapika if anything was wrong. Kurapika deactivates his Dowsing Chain, puts his gun away, and steps out to reassure the participants that they were fine, and gives the explanation that negotiations were taking a while because they could not agree on the terms of the truce. Kurapika promises to explain it fully afterwards to clear up any doubt the participants have, and asks them for their patience. Furykov observes Kurapika when he steps out, and wonders what they were talking about, believing that they had noticed that Longhi was responsible for Barrigen and Myuhan's deaths but noting no change in Kurapika's aura. Kurapika returns to the master bedroom. He closes the door, then reactivates Dowsing Chain and redraws his gun. Longhi begins to explain the details of the contract she wants to have Kurapika agree to. She begins by explaining the contract with Tubeppa and its details: Kurapika makes sure to have Longhi clarify the definition of \"attack\", and she does so before promising to write Kurapika another contract if Tubeppa drops out before he can help her and explaining her additional stipulations for her true plan: Kurapika notes that Dowsing Chain has not indicated that Longhi is lying. Having finally explained everything, Longhi asks Kurapika to listen to one final request before signing, and reveals her current true planâ€”should Beyond's child be among the Princes, to kill them herself. She laments at Beyond's control over her, saying that she would have never made the decision to do so if Beyond had told her everything. Kurapika agrees to Longhi's contract, and agrees to collaborate with Tubeppa. The participants watch the three step out. Furykov feels something slightly different from before in Kurapika's aura, but is unable to discern if it's a change in himself or if it was Longhi's Nen. Furykov wonders if his deduction that Longhi was the assassin was incorrect. Kurapika invites Tenftory in and mentions that he would be the last to have his Nen awakened that day, saying that he would discuss the matter afterward. Tenftory later reports to Zhang Lei that all of the students who have taken Kurapika's Nen training are able to utilize Nen. Later, at 1:30 p.m. on the tenth day of the voyage, Tenftory in Room 1003 and Maor and Longhi in Room 1005 simultaneously give their Princes an update on the succession contest. Tenftory tells Zhang Lei that Woble and Tubeppa had agreed to defer the throne to him if they were the final three Princes, in exchange for Sakata and Hashito extending their support indefinitely. Coventoba observes their conversation. Maor tells Tubeppa that Kurapika had entered their truce and agreed to their alliance on the condition that Oito and Woble accompany him whenever he comes to Room 1005. Rihan, watching their conversation nearby, notes that Tubeppa's team were colluding with Kurapika. In Kaiser's office on Tier 2 at 8:50 a.m. on the eleventh day, Melody hopes that the Kurapika would come up with a plan so that no more Princes had to die, as he reads a letter similar in appearance to the one that Fugetsu had passed to the other Princes, containing information that Kaiser and Melody had decided to leak to each Prince. In Room 1014 sometime that day, Kurapika speaks to Oito and tells her that death is the punishment awaiting anyone who tries to leave the ship during the succession, and that unfortunately, the ship itself is the urn for the worm toxin. Otio disappointedly understands that the Princes must continue until only one is left alive. Kurapika interjects and says that while it was true that the powerful Nen enveloping the ship makes it seem that nothing but death is allowed, he thinks that there is hope, surprising Oito. He asks her for her permission to go public with her letter, during the second round of the Nen workshop, scheduled to begin the next day. Attendance will be up to the Princes, and he plans to let them know that he would make the letter public during the lessons, for three reasons: In Room 1003 at roughly the same time, Zhang Lei gathers his guards and try to figure out the functionality of the coins his Guardian Spirit Beast had produced. They see that most coins have a '1' on it although one coin had a '10' on it, but get nowhere meaningful. Zhang Lei decides that he needs Kurapika to get through identifying information on Nen that could affect the battle for the throne, as well as his Guardian Spirit Beast's ability and effects, and asks for Room 1014 to be contacted. Sometime after 1:00 p.m., Kurapika makes his way to Room 1003, together with Oito and Woble. There, he tells Zhang Lei that he had pretty much confirmed his guess that the coins change after ten days. Kurapika says that there should be an upper limit to how many coins can be produced in order to maintain their physical forms, though in Zhang Lei's case the costs are shared by distributing them to others which makes mass production possible. Kurapika points out that the point of currency is to change hands and suggests verifying what changes occur in that case. He starts by asking if there are any differences in design between the ones he has and the ones given to others. Tenftory notices that his coin has a different design and brings it to them to for them to see. They notice that though the front is the same, the back designs are differentâ€”Tenftory's coin has an image of Zhang Lei inscribed, but Zhang Lei's coin has an image of his Guardian Spirit Beast inscribed. In order to see what happens when coins are exchanged, Kurapika asks Zhang Lei to give one of his coins to Tenftory, but Zhang Lei instead decides to give Kurapika the '10' coin. Kurapika is surprised and worried but does so in case he loses Zhang Lei's trust by refusing the coin. Kurapika reassures himself by thinking that even if accepting the coin was the condition for activating a semi-coercive manipulation ability, the Nen stored in a coin over ten days is not enough to force powerful commands like murder to be followed. Since only one coin was produced a day and they take ten days to change, Kurapika sees that it is a long-term outlook, an ability that will only demonstrate its true value after Zhang Lei becomes king which reflects his personality to plan ahead, from which Kurapika concludes that accepting the coin is safe enough for now. When Kurapika accepts the coin, it is engulfed in a small burst of aura, and design on the back changes from an inscription of Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast to an inscription of Zhang Lei. He notes that the number and design changed to match Tenftory's, and Zhang Lei guesses that a coin's time and effect reset when it changes hands. Kurapika returns the coin back to Zhang Lei, and the two note that the design returned to an inscription of Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast, but the number did not revert back to '10' and remained as '1'. After observing this, Kurapika says that he now has a rough idea of his ability. He asks if he should share his theory there, but Zhang Lei says he does not mind, and guarantees that it was not something that would threaten Benjamin. Kurapika picks up on Zhang Lei's implicit instructions to not reveal how the ability could be a threat, and gets a better idea of Zhang Lei and how to work with him. Kurapika tells Zhang Lei that his beast can be presumed to have a cumulative conjuration ability; contrary to normal currency that is to be circulated, Zhang Lei's coins are instead to be held long-term to store Nen, perhaps enabling them to exhibit various powers later on. Kurapika suggests that in about six months, the owner of the coin could have their aura nodes opened, making them ready to be use Nen. Kurapika suggests that Zhang Lei's estimate of the number reaching 1064 could be the required amount for a Nen ability to manifest, and that this might be an optimal way to bypass the normally rigorous training needed to learn Nen and the risks involved. He also says that a cumulative ability is often seen in intellectual people and those who like to head, suggesting that the ability prepares for a time after Zhang Lei assumes the throne. Zhang Lei laughs in delight at how fitting the ability Kurapika suggests is for him. In line with his understanding of Zhang Lei's instructions, Kurapika keeps his ideas on how the coins could threaten others to himself. He thinks that in exchange for awakening Nen using a method as close to risk- and cost-free as possible, Zhang Lei's Guardian Spirit Beast requires compensation, likely in the form of pseudo-coercive manipulation, or semi-forced loyalty to Zhang Lei. Kurapika decides to keep these thoughts to himself since it would make unnecessary waves and also wants to let the coin do its things and see its effects on Coventoba, who Kurapika guesses hid the coin that appeared on the first day. Since it was the eleventh day and most abilities that counted days as a condition take the moment of emergence as the first day, Kurapika guesses that there should have been two '10' coins, and since Zhang Lei only had one, Kurapika guesses that Coventoba, the only one present who can use Nen and is not affiliated with Zhang Lei, had picked it up and kept it to himself because he is aware of what going on and did not want to give information with Zhang Lei. Kurapika also notes that Coventoba's presence at their discussion could be used as an excuse to explain why he did not share the possibility that his coins had a manipulative ability, since Zhang Lei did not want Kurapika to mention anything about the ability that could be a threat to Benjamin. Zhang Lei thanks Kurapika, and says that he can now spend his time thinking about how to spend his future with his siblings. Kurapika points out that the number of coins Zhang Lei holds could also have an effect, and suggest that he hold on to some coins for now. Zhang Lei agrees and decides to give Kurapika the coin that appeared that day, but hold on to the rest for now. Kurapika thanks him, and says that he needs to ask Zhang Lei to wait a while longer for their other matter, and says that his second round of Nen lessons should be key. Zhang Lei acknowledges this and says that there can never be too much information, but it is not urgent and that he is more worried about Kurapika and Woble's security detail. Zhang Lei advises him that it was likely that others had used the first round of Nen lessons to gather intel and lay their groundwork, and suggests that Kurapika prepare himself. Zhang Lei thinks to himself and internally tells Kurapika not to think of them as equals, that he was only accepting information in exchange for ensuring Woble's safety. Kurapika thanks Zhang Lei for his concern, and thinks about how it was extremely beneficial to be under Zhang Lei's protection in exchange for information on Nen pertaining to the succession battle, despite the great risks it comes with. Zhang Lei is one of the three Princes that were benefactors to a Mafia family and the combat potential of the over two hundred mafia members on board the lower Tiers served as inhibition against the higher Princes. Kurapika notes that the power balance between Zhang Lei, Tserriednich, and Luzurus is important, and the situation could change drastically if it tipped too far. If the balance between the mafia breaks, Benjamin has reason to enact martial law and place all the Princes under house arrest under the guise of protection, where he has free reign to do as he wishes. Because the balance between the mafia families and their associated Princes was so stable, war breaking out is likely to lead to the assassination of a Prince, and if a Prince's death is interpreted as a mafia hit, the resulting mafia war would lead to martial law. Kurapika worries that Benjamin might go after one of the three mafia Princes to force this situation, and that given his personality, might even kill Woble despite Zhang Lei living with her, to emphasize the cruelty of the mafia and shift the blame onto them. Kurapika considers staying in Room 1014 where each Prince's guards served as a check for the others, but worries about the snakes and the danger that each Prince is plotting something. Which choice to make is up to his gut decision, but they are on thin ice either way. Back in Room 1014, Kurapika notifies the guards of the other Princes' present in Room 1014 that the second round of Nen classes would begin the next morning at 9 a.m. He first speaks to Babimyna, and lets him know that the format would be the same as before, but Camilla's guards would join this time. Babimyna confirms for Kurapika that he and Furykov would continue to be Benjamin's representatives, then Kurapika asks Sakata and Hashito for ideas on why Camilla might have changed her mind about sending representatives. Sakata suggests she might be verifying Kurapika's claims, and that since they know what happened because of the last round of Nen lessons, there must be some benefit for Camilla's side. Hashito points out that many possible reasons could be possible. Babimyna observes their exchange and thinks about how Camilla's Have-Nots used curses unique to them, and wonders if they are Nen abilities, and if they were really targeting Woble. Because Camilla chose to only send one representative, Kurapika guesses that they have a firm resolve, and from Camilla's personality guesses that they had a goal other than learning. He thinks about how Melody's letter to him did not mention Camilla, and wonders if Camilla had a secret that forced her to act. Kurapika tells Bill that they had to keep Camilla's guards away from Woble as much as possible, and tells him that they would go through the tough shifts together. He then tells Shimano to stay by the Queen and Prince's sides, and to leave chores until later. He remembers the contract he has with Zhang Lei, and keeps in mind to be careful."

Hence useful for investigation, the chain can be used to determine the location of missing individuals and identify if someone is lying . If the chain's ability is used in a group, it works better if the persons questioned reply one at a time. Under ordinary conditions, Kurapika must be directly in front of the target for the lie detection to be effective; however, when Emperor Time is active, he can also use that ability through video recordings, provided he has met the subject before. Kurapika himself is unaware of how this side of his power works, his guess being that, through the conveyance of the chain and extreme focus, he can unconsciously detect subtle indications that someone is lying.",

The chain's conjuration speed is such that Kurapika can fully restrain a distant target in half a second.

Thus, if Kurapika's \"Level\" in Conjuration was 10, his \"Level\" in Emission would remain 4 at the most, but his \"Force\" and \"Accuracy\" in any Emission ability would increase from 40% to 100%, making him evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter.

        "Stealth Dolphin": {
            "Description": "By activating Emperor Time, Kurapika can summon a dolphin-like Nen Beast with a syringe on each pectoral fin that is visible and audible only to himself. This construct can \"equip\" and analyze the stolen ability, informing Kurapika of its name, functions, and conditions. Kurapika can then use the stolen ability for himself or loan it to another person, including non-users, by using the syringe from Steal Chain to inject it into them. If the ability is loaned, a listening device is conjured in the recipient's ear that enables them to see the dolphin and communicate with it via telepathy. The dolphin can counsel the recipient on how to use the ability, and will utilize it itself when given the order by the recipient of the loaned ability. When Kurapika or someone he has loaned an ability to activates it, it is fueled with the aura that Steal Chain took from its owner, ensuring that it is used with its original power. A side-effect of Stealth Dolphin is that when it is used on a non-user it will allow them to see aura and, after the loaned ability is activated, semi-force all of their Aura Nodes open, essentially making them Nen users, although training is still necessary to control one's own aura flow and prevent its leakage. Suppose Kurapika equips the dolphin with a stolen ability and transfers it to someone else. In that case, he can use Steal Chain again and steal another ability. Transferring it does not allow him to exit Emperor Time until he can dismiss the dolphin, which can only be done if Stealth Dolphin does not hold an ability. Kurapika does not need to load Stealth Dolphin with an ability, but if he does, he is unable to dismiss it until the ability is used at least once, even if the loading is only done for purposes of analyzing the ability. Regardless of who controls it, a stolen ability can be used only once, after which it is returned to the original user. As a downside, as long as all stolen abilities are not returned, Emperor Time will remain active. The dolphin will regularly notify Kurapika of how long Emperor Time has been active for unless it is put on standby, in which case it can be made to disappear.
