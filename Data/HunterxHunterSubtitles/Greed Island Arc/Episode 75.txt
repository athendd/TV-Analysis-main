Don't worry.
We aren't here to get in your way.
In fact, you could say we're here to help.
Help?
Yeah.
If we get the top score on
the quiz and win the card,
we want to sell it to you for 2.5 billion.
That's only five percent of your reward.
It's a reasonable price, yeah?
Oh, right...
They haven't heard about Battera yet.
Sure, if you get the top score.
Everyone else is here for the chance
to sell us the final card, too?
With the game ending,
they're all hoping to share in the reward.
It looks like they're going
to take the quiz in teams.
What should we do?
What? We should do it by ourselves.
Yeah.
Whoever scores lower gets penalized.
Okay, I'm in!
Honestly... They've got guts.
They just came from a fight to the death,
and now they're facing the final event
in the game with such confidence.
I bet those two enjoyed this
game more than anyone.
Keep it up.
Ging's Friends x And x True Friends

The quiz is over.
I will now announce the player with the top score.
With a score of 87 out of 100 points,
our top scoring player
is Gon.
Yes!
We have all one hundred!
You did it.
I hate to say it, but you beat us...
Congratulations.
Thanks.
That means Killua gets penalized.
Damn...
How many points did I get?
Ruler's Invitation?
Ruler's Invitation
An invitation from
this island's ruler.
The envelope contains
a map that shows the
castle and a badge.
Player must have badge
to enter the castle.
Looks like only the one with
the badge is invited.
So Limeiro is the capital?
I have to go alone?
We'll wait for you by the castle.
Hey, he really got it.
That kid really collected all the cards.
Hey, let's have a contest with
all your cards at stake.
Sorry, but you don't have a choice.
Then I'll take an Accompany card.
Wait, that won't work.
We haven't been to Limeiro before.
So we should use Drift...
Since we've been to the other cities before.
Drift
Transports you to a
previously unvisited city.
(If all cities have been
visited, Drift is used,
without transporting player.)
[SR][NORM]
In that case, I'll use Drift to go to Limeiro,
then come back for you guys.
Accompany will work after that.
Drift on!
Bingo!
Accompany
Warp all players within 20 meters
of caster to city (must have been visited)
or player of your choice (must have
been met inside the game).
[SR][NORM]
Let's go, Gon.
Yep.
Accompany on!
Limeiro!
Those kids are amazing.
They wiped the floor with the Belum brothers.
Of course...
They even defeated the bombers.
It's true,
those boys are much stronger
than when I first met them.
But they're still weaker than
Genthru in raw power.
They must have executed a brilliant plan...
Well, no matter.
I'll let you have the reward for beating the game.
Magnetic Force on.
Chrollo Lucilfer.
I'll head back to reality and
make a fortune exorcising Nen.
I wonder what he's feeling.
What he's feeling?
He might meet Ging, after all.
The father he's been searching for all this time.
Welcome to Greed Island Castle.
Come in.
This place is a dump!
I've brought the top scorer, Gon-kun.
Oh, hey! I've been waiting for you!
I hear you're Ging's son?
Why don't you have a seat?
Uh...
Where should I sit?
Isn't there any open space?
Clear some space, then...
Like this!
Uh...
Wait, where did I put it?
Oh! Here it is!
There you go.
Ruler's Blessing
Castle awarded to the
winner of the quiz.
Comes with capital city
(population 10,000).
The city's residents
will obey any laws or
commands you give.
Ruler's Blessing,
the reward for the top scorer.
How about it?!
Isn't it cool?
Are you amazed? Well?
There are 10,000 people in this city.
One of them could be...
Wait, did I get your hopes up?
Well?
Or were you just thinking that
Ging could be the ruler?
I was not!
I never considered that Ging might be here.
Oh, really now?
That's good, then...
Since he's not.
Dwun-san, can we get to business?
Oh, my bad.
Listen up.
You've collected all one hundred cards.
Which triggers a new event.
Hmm...
Oh, here it is!
This is it.
Open it up.
You can place three restricted
slot cards in this binder.
You can then take those three back
for use in the real world.
However!
You cannot take multiple
copies of the same card.
You must choose three different restricted
slot cards from the hundred in your binder.
Okay, you've reached the ending...
Do you want the normal ending,
or the ending just for you?
Just for me?
Yep, that's right.
Which one do you want? Well?
Then I'll take the normal one.
Why would you choose that one?
I didn't clear the game alone, and if it's
the normal ending, my friends
can watch with me, right?
I see...
Dwun-san?
Huh?
Would you stop teasing him?
I'm sorry...
There's no such thing as an ending just for you.
What? Really?
However, there's a message we've been told
to give you only after you beat the game.
Sorry for taking so long to introduce ourselves.
I'm List.
He's Dwun.
As you probably know,
we're friends of your old man.
This game was created by Ging
and ten of his friends.
The name "Greed Island" was created
from the first letter in each of their names.
Your father was in charge,
so we wanted a word that began
with "G," and settled on "Greed."
Have you met Razor?
He's the "R," and I'm the "L."
The girl who explains the game at the start
is the twin of the girl you see
when leaving the island.
Eeta and Elena.
Both names begin with "E."
And then, we have "D"!
Wanna hear my story? Well?
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
Y-Yeah...
Okay, pay attention.
You see, that Ging...
was a totally mean guy!
Totally mean!
My name is Dwun!
What do you think is the first letter?
Huh? Isn't it "D"?
Even you, huh?
Of course you'd think so...
After all, you're Ging's son.
Weren't we talking about "D"?
It's "W!" "W!"
W-d-w-u-n-e.
Wdwune!
That was my name!
But even my oldest friends
thought it began with "D."
So when we decided on the
game's name, I was clear...
That my name began with "W."
What do you think Ging said?
Really?
Then, ditch the "W."
Starting now, your name is D-w-u-n...
Dwun.
Can you believe him?
He changed my name without asking.
Just so the title of the game would work!
What's really amazing
is that Ging had legally changed
the name a minute later.
He only needed a phone and a computer.
What's worse is that he even removed
the "E" because he got confused!
But your luck has been better as a result.
I guess! Ever since...
Once I've chosen the three cards,
I'm supposed to go to the port.
Did they tell you about your father?
Yeah, but they don't know
where he is right now.
Oh...
So I guess the game didn't have any clues.
Well, that's what the starting message said.
Yeah, that's true.
So, what will you do for the three cards?
How about we each pick one?
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.
Then I want Blue Planet!
This is still the best one!
I can't wait to see the real thing...
Which one do you want, Killua?
I'm still thinking.
Have you decided, Gon?
Yeah, I think so.
Really? Which one?
Let's see...
This one.
Which one?
Wait, why this one?
I get it.
That makes sense.
You're only allowed to take
restricted slot cards...
Yep, that sounds fun!
When did you have the idea?
The moment I saw this card.
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.
But this one won't be enough.
Right, we also need this one.
Transform
Change one card in your possession into any
other card in your possession. (Card will now
count against the limit of new card type. If limit has already been reached, nothing will happen,
and the Transform card will be destroyed.)
[SR][NORM]
Eh?
Do you think this will work?
Yeah.
And this is the only way to do it!
Wait, what is this?
What are you talking about?
You're okay with Blue Planet, Bisky?
Let me in on this!
Congratulations on clearing the game.
Please choose three restricted
slot cards from your binder.
You've chosen #2, Patch of Shore,
Patch of Shore
The entrance to an
underwater cavern known
as the Sea God's Grotto.
The cavern changes
every time you enter.
Blue Planet
A gemstone with an
incomparable blue shine.
Its composition matches
no known minerals,
so it's named for its
otherworldly nature.
#81, Blue Planet,
Paladin's Necklace
When a player wears this,
all spells targeting player
will be reflected.
Can also dispel curses
placed on any card
touched by player.
and #84, Paladin's Necklace.
Are you sure these are the three cards you want?
Yep.
Then I will now return your ring.
Good work.
Thank you...
Uh, Elena-san!
You remembered my name?
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Welcome back!
Yeah.
We're back in the real world now?
I can't tell.
Well, the game was part of the real world.
Hey, hurry up!
Bring out your binder...
Book.
Gain!
This is it!
This is what I wanted!
The Blue Planet I've dreamed of for so long!
I'm so happy!
What should I name it?
Pla-chan?
Maybe Blue-chan?
Planet-chan?
Yep, I'll go with Planet-chan!
So, are you sure about the two you picked?
Yeah, these are the best ones, right?
Yep.
Then let's give it a go!
Yeah!
Gain!
Give it to me, Killua.
Yes! It worked!
Okay!
I see.
You used Transform to make
Accompany a restricted slot card,
then used Paladin's Necklace to revert it.
That's clever thinking...
But I'm surprised you'd do
all that for an Accompany,
rather than choose a restricted slot card.
Yeah...
Well, if I hadn't been the first
one of us to enter the game,
I probably wouldn't have noticed.
Remember when we played
rock-paper-scissors here?
Rock-paper-scissors?
Yeah.
I was the first to enter the game.
And while I was waiting for Killua,
no one else was around.
Which means the first person I met in the game
should have been the second
one to go in, Goreinu-san.
But when I checked my binder,
there was someone I met before him.
Nigg
Goreinu
Ging is spelled G-i-n-g.
Oh, so Nigg is an anagram!
My guess is that when I was a
baby, I came here with Ging.
He was probably trying to tell me this:
If I'm ready to give up everything to find him,
I have to get strong enough
to clear the game...
Your dedication is really something.
Well? What will you do once you find Ging?
Naturally, I'll introduce him to Killua!
My best friend in the world!
Stupid! Cut that out!
It's embarrassing...
Really...
Stop it...
I can't take this!
It must be age.
It doesn't take much to make me cry...
Hey, wanna come with us to see Ging?
No, I'll pass.
I'm not interested in men who already have kids.
Okay.
If I stay with you any longer,
I really will get too attached.
Well, take care, Bisky.
Yeah.
You, too.
Thank you very much!
Osu!
Accompany on!
Nigg!
Bye-bye.
Gon has cleared the game his father created,
becoming much stronger.
Is the one waiting before him really Ging?
G.I. Tutorial
Coming up, it's the
Greed Island Tutorial!
Today, we beat Greed Island.
We've introduced a whole bunch of cards.
I did all the introducing!
You just fooled aro—
