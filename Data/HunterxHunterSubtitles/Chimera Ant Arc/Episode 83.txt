Been a while since I flipped my switch on.
Scissors!
Well?
Look at this!
I feel reborn!
Inspiration x To x Evolve
The Hunters Association
has learned of the Chimera Ants
from the biological survey team,
and now awaits the world leaders'
decision on how to handle them.
We're counting on you.
You have a single mission.
The immediate extermination
of these dangerous creatures.
There have already been many casualties.
We will use any means necessary.
Will that be acceptable?
Naturally, we have no intention of
telling the experts how to proceed.
We simply desire
those dangerous creatures
eradicated as swiftly as possible.
Understood.
So their goal is to eradicate the Ants,
leaving the Hunters Association
to take the blame.
Th-The Chimera Ants
have five ranks, w-with the Queen at the top.
Queen
There's the Queen.
Royal Guard
Under her is the Royal Guard,
Squadron Leaders
and then, the Squadron Leaders.
Under the Squadron Leaders are Captains,
and they oversee many foot
soldiers and other grunts.
A-And once the King is born,
the hierarchy shifts like so.
The Royal Guard that followed the Queen
switches into the King's service.
A-Afterwards, Squadron Leaders
report directly to the Queen,
and she focuses on directing the soldiers.
The Queen remains in the castle,
periodically giving birth to Kings.
The Kings travel and mate
with different organisms,
so as to breed new Queens.
That explains their fast reproduction rate.
To prevent a Chimera Ant population explosion,
you must defeat the Queen before
she can give birth to a King.
But first, you need to defeat
all the soldiers guarding her.
That's a tall order.
Got it. We'll be waiting.
The punitive force's first wave is on its way.
Punitive force?
I wonder who they'll send.
They'll be facing those vicious Chimera Ants.
They'll be strong.
They'd better be!
I'm worried about Kite and the kids.
They'll arrive in three days.
How?
Look at this!
Isn't it incredible?
Why does Rammot have so much life energy?
There must have been some catalyst.
A catalyst...
Rock...
Paper...
Rock!
That hurts...
Damn...
What if their attacks were the catalyst?
I can feel the power filling me!
Peggy...
I told you that we are capable
of anything that humans are.
Including the use of this strange power?
But this is...
Rammot, while you have that power, hit me.
Wh-What are you saying?
You've been ticking me off,
so I won't go easy on you.
I'm assuming that's what it takes.
Then I won't hold back.
Come.
Colt!
This is a message from Hagya.
This is a message from Hagya.
The ultimate prey is either
within the factory or nearby.
Capture it.
Capture it...
Dead or alive.
Capture it!
Hagya-sama...
What is it?
Do you believe they will succeed?
There are enough Captains for a decent fight.
For a decent fight, huh?
But I doubt they'll be much help.
I'm fine with that.
Why is that?
They're just buying time for us to arrive.
Oh, I see.
Then the rare humans will be ours to take.
Exactly.
We're surrounded.
Their numbers are great.
Now, then...
Let's decide order and methodology.
As for our targets, you have three choices.
One...
Decide the order in which you will fight.
Two, attempt to escape.
Three, give up and let us capture you.
If you choose option one,
you will fight one-on-one battles with us
for a chance to survive.
I don't recommend the second option.
You'll anger us, resulting in a brutal capture
and prolonged suffering for all of you.
Option three is out of the question.
That would anger us even more than option two.
So, what will you do?
Kite...
We couldn't have asked for a better deal.
One-on-one fights with their Captains.
We'll start with whoever is prepared to fight.
I'll go.
No, I will.
First comes rock!
Rock, paper, scissors!
Okay, I'm first!
While the Ants have inherited
individualism from humans,
they've lost the unity that's
characteristic of ants.
I hope we'll be able
to take advantage of that change.
Well, we need to decide who
to send from our side.
#6...
#6!
Who's #6?
Lucky me!
Baro?
How will the victor be decided?
Eh? That should be obvious.
Whoever dies first loses.
We can't just surrender?
What?!
Are you crazy?
If you lose, we'll feed you to the Queen.
If you don't defeat me,
you're guaranteed to die!
Yeah, I'm okay with that.
But there's no need for you to die.
If I beat you, I won't want to eat you.
If you surrender, you'll live.
But if you lose,
you must promise never to eat another human.
This guy isn't taking us seriously!
He has more pep than any human I've seen!
Lucky you, Baro-chan!
I'll kill you!
You managed to dodge that one.
Then how about this?
The same attack?
Gon!
He altered course.
I'm fine.
Why are you so tough?
By this point, the rest were vomiting organs.
Whatever...
Just need a few more times.
There's no way to dodge my homing roll!
Indeed...
He only has to alter his course to
match the direction Gon dodges.
What will you do, Gon?
Kid, I have something to
tell you before I kill you.
The main reason we kill humans isn't to eat them
or to feed them to the Queen.
Then why?
Because it's fun!
I love the sound as humans
vomit their own organs
with a plop!
It's hilarious because it looks like barf.
That isn't funny.
I'll make you vomit your own
organs with a plop, too!
He didn't dodge...
But stopped him.
Compared to Razor's spikes,
this is nothing!
Well, we're in a hurry.
Who's my opponent?
Hey!
#3.
#3's up!
You won't be smiling for long.
I'm about to show you hell.
Got it?
I'm nothing like the trash over there.
Trash?
Huh? I said trash because he's trash.
I'm ten times stronger than that guy.
Oh, that's nothing to brag about.
What was that?!
When they enter battle,
their aura becomes much stronger.
They're at their best in battle.
Gon tends to have an agitatingly slow start,
but we should have time.
We'll reach the Queen before
she gives birth to the King.
But why
do I have such a bad feeling?
I feel like I'm missing something.
There's a gnawing anxiety that won't go away.
Look, Peggy!
I can freely control this energy!
This is incredible!
We should do more research.
Eh?
If we learn the proper way
to wield this power,
we can synchronize it with our natural abilities
to make it an even stronger weapon.
You're too retentive...
Zazan...
She said she captured a rare
human a few days ago...
If we're lucky,
he's still in the storeroom.
Find and secure him.
My entire body is covered by hardened skin.
I can take as many of those
attacks as you can throw!
Oh, yeah?
Is there anyone ten times
stronger than this guy?
This is a pleasant surprise.
Their Captains can be dispatched easily enough.
Am I worried over nothing?
That's enough... It's my turn!
2!
What?
Two, huh?
Damn, bad spin.
Killua...
That scythe is nasty.
Gon, Killua...
In three seconds, jump up.
Wh-What is this overwhelming pressure?
Right!
I've experienced this sensation before!
Silent Waltz: Grim Reaper's Dance
I remember now.
This is
death!
Murder via overwhelming force.
Get lost.
This scythe can be used
only with this technique.
And it won't disappear until I've used it.
It's such a drag...
So why did you choose that power?
Be cautious as we advance.
As I mentioned, that won't be
enough to kill them immediately.
Are you okay?
It's only getting worse from here.
If you start to sympathize with the enemy,
you won't be able to handle what's coming.
I'm fine.
I have no sympathy for bugs
that call each other trash.
That's a dangerous view.
What would you do if one of those
bugs cared for its comrades?
Kite, Gon, and Killua head toward
the Chimera Ant Queen's castle
to prevent the King's birth.
Next time: A x Fated x Awakening.
I'll go.
No, I will!
No, me!
Then I'll go.
Go right ahead.
