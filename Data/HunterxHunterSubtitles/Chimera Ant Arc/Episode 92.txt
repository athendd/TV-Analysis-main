I never knew
how frustrating
weakness could be!
Gon...
For the thirty days that you can't use Nen...
I'll protect you.
I will do whatever it takes!
One Wish x And x Two Promises
Colt arrived, under a white flag of
surrender, to ask the Hunters a favor.
His wish was that they save the dying Queen.
After hearing his request, Morel and
Knov took Colt to see Netero.
It's me.
Send over a team of Chimera Ant
researchers immediately.
Hmm?
The king has been born.
Contact Dr. Lee, of the Bonrin Medical School,
and have him bring all
his skilled surgeons and artificial organ experts.
We leave in four hours.
Yes, sir.
We will do everything we can.
Colt-kun...
We'll need your cooperation.
Heart
This may be the last time I wear this...
Hey, is that...
Yes, it's his "heart" T-shirt.
Heart
They say it's a lucky shirt he only
wears when he fights for real.
But I always thought it was a just a rumor...
Colt-kun, it appears that you can use Nen...
Since you've been in the King's presence,
I want you to give me your honest opinion.
How do I compare to the King?
He really is special...
It feels like needles pricking
me all over my body.
Most likely,
you will be unable to lay a finger on him.
You'll be killed by one of his Royal Guard
before you can get close enough.
I see...
I'm happy to hear that.
At this age, I'll be a challenger.
This is exciting stuff.
Morel, I believe your disciples
were to fight today, yes?
Yes.
Take the victors and the research team,
along with Colt, to the nest.
And you, Chairman?
You don't plan to pursue the King alone?
Oh, no...
I'm off to see an old acquaintance.
Don't forget to pay me my one million.
I know.
What are you talking about?
Nothing important.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Everyone else has left.
Most of our soldiers joined
other squadrons and left.
Though a few oddballs did leave
their squadrons to stay here.
I suppose it's fortunate no fighting broke out.
Did you stop the bleeding?
Yes, but I couldn't do anything else for her.
I'm not sure we can, either.
Don't expect too much.
For now, we'll hook her up to artificial organs.
Can you use my organs?
You can have all my blood, as well!
Unfortunately, it won't work.
Chimera Ants from different generations
are completely different organisms.
Just look at how much the Chimera
Ants in your own generation vary.
But the sentiment is appreciated.
We'll do our best, so pray...
That, miraculously, all the organs will function.
Pray...
Is that all I can do?
Someone...
Is anyone there?
Yes, I am by your side!
Please give me your command!
What is it?
Telepathy?
Yes,
the Queen cannot speak as we do.
Can you tell us what she's saying?
Perhaps she has a hint for saving her life.
My son...
Is my son all right?
Did he have any defects?
...defects?
You have nothing to worry about.
He is perfectly healthy, and right now...
And right now, he's taken
the Royal Guard to search
for medicine to help you.
...to help you.
The truth is that, after he killed
and ate Squadron Leaders,
he left in search of a new territory.
I doubt he will return.
He ate them?
The King
has no concern for the Queen's health!
Then, the King is safe?
Yes.
That is wonderful...
Oh, no.
Send the King off at once.
There is no time to waste on my well-being...
My son has the potential to rule the world.
He was born too early,
so I was very worried.
However, it appears...
I have fulfilled my duty...
That was all I wanted.
What are you saying?!
You are our guiding light...
Without you, the rest of us will
lose our way and perish.
I know my body better than anyone else...
I will not last much longer.
However, I have
no regrets.
Please stop!
I beg you... Please live!
Use my body! Please!
Give it a shot!
Until you try, you don't know it won't work!
Listen...
You must listen to what the Queen has to say.
I have one last request...
I thought of a name...
for my son.
For the King...
A name?
Meruem.
It means the light that illuminates all.
Deliver my message to him...
My beloved son...
I failed to protect her again...
I can't protect anyone...
Has something like this happened before?
No, he's probably referring to a memory
from when he was human.
You have memories from
when you were human?
Of course, though naturally, some
remember more than others...
Our human personalities
strongly influence our current behavior.
And many can remember their human names.
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been
as easy to learn to speak.
Hmm?
Th-This is...
There's...
There's something moving!
Don't touch it!
I will...
I will remove it.
I shall protect this child...
I swear it!
This time, I won't fail...
Morel?
Colt...
Can you promise me
that you and that child
will never eat humans?
If you can't make that promise,
you should get out of my sight immediately.
But if you're willing to give your word...
No one will ever lay a finger on you,
not as long as I'm around.
You have my promise!
It isn't a big deal...
I inherited my soft nature from my master.
Okay, I've recovered!
Knuckle and the other Hunters will save Kite.
So I have to become stronger!
So that Kite won't be disappointed
when he comes back.
Ah, so you do understand.
You may have met Kite before we did,
but we've spent more time with him.
After we crossed the mountains, if you'd still
been moping, I would've given you a beating...
And told you that Kite wouldn't
want to see you two like this.
I know he's still alive,
and he doesn't want you to have regrets.
Right now, what should you do?
You must make the correct decision,
and find the will to follow through!
If you're too weak, train more.
There's enough space here
for squats and push-ups.
Yeah, you're right.
Hey, Spin...
Hmm?
Why do you want to be a Hunter?
I need the money to repay a huge debt.
Have you heard of the small-billed swan?
Nope...
It's a species of bird that can only live
in the area around a certain mine.
No one knows why that is.
Is it the water? The food? The weather?
So I bought the entire area where the mine is.
Well, the mine's closed down now.
Kite provided the money for that.
He was the first adult who was willing to listen
to kids who had nothing at all.
Stinn and I were born in that area.
The sight of thousands of small-billed swans taking
flight with the light of dawn at their backs...
That's the oldest, but strongest,
memory Stinn and I have.
When we heard the area would be demolished,
we realized how important it was to us...
Kite said that he envied us.
He doesn't have a home.
Because he doesn't know where he was born.
Once this mission is over,
I can show you two
my treasure.
Th-This is...
Goal!
I am the Speed King.
No one can stop me!
Given Cheetu's speed, he's probably
already crossed the border.
Well, I'll take my time searching...
For my own paradise,
with plenty of food and females.
Cows, pigs, humans, boars, bears...
I'll take any of those if they're plentiful.
Because I am the Glutton King.
The Chimera Ants that were once soldiers
have now departed to become kings.
Meanwhile, the King
is now in the Republic of East Gorteau.
Next time: Date x With x Palm.
A date! A date!
Gon, do you understand what a date is?
Huh? Sure.
It's when a man and womanâ€”
Th-Th-That's enough!
