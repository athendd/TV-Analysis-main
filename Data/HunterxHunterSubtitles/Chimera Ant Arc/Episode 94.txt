I have to defeat him,
or it's all over!
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!
Friend x And x Journey
Determined to protect Gon
for the thirty days he can't use Nen,
Killua prepares for a fight with a Chimera Ant.
However...
Run.
Yes! That's more like it!
That terrified expression...
I love it!
Damn, I'm getting excited now...
I'm gonna tear you apart.
If you aren't certain you can win, run.
I have to protect him... I have to...
When you know nothing of your opponent...
...protect Gon.
...run away.
No matter what!
Is there something special about that tree?
Just wait a little longer.
Amazing...
They're seaside fireflies.
They're only found around brackish water,
and this is their breeding season.
It's beautiful!
Isn't it?
You piss yourself or something?
Well?!
Can't even move a muscle?
Lose your spine?
Damn, this feels so good...
Should I kill him?
Ah, but I want to enjoy this!
Here.
It's a present.
This is the most beautiful flower in the world.
It is?
Stay still.
The tree's sap is very similar to
the pheromones fireflies emit,
so they tend to gather around branches.
I'm so happy...
Thank you.
Really?
I'm glad to hear that.
But I...
I can't give you what you truly want.
What I truly want?
Time alone with me.
Eh?
I...
I want to become stronger.
Strong enough to defeat the Chimera Ants.
That means I have to train harder.
In two days, Kite's coming back.
But it sounds like he's under enemy control.
To return him to normal, I'll probably
have to fight whoever is controlling him.
So until Kite is back to normal...
Or if possible, until the
Chimera Ants are defeated...
I want to focus on my training.
Yes... Yes!
Are you okay with that?
Huh?
What was that?
Damn! I can't get enough!
Run...
Hurry.
No...
Gon!
I will...
...protect you.
Because
we're friends...
You're my dear friend!
Stop that...
Don't look at me like that.
I c-can't stop myself...
I'll kill you.
I'll kill you! I'll kill you...
Run.
Shut up!
Run.
I won't listen to you!
Run... Run... Run...
Shut up!
I'll leave the head, but eat the rest!
Run.
I don't want
to lose him!
Run.
Gon is...
Run.
...my...
Run.
...dear...
Run.
It has to be Killua.
My very dear friend!
He disappeared?
He fooled me good.
Illumi must have planted this
inside my head.
Huh? What are you talking about?
Have you lost your mind?
And how did you dodge that?
Wait, I saw the whole thing.
Right before I reached him,
he jammed his finger into his own head.
And then he vanished,
before popping up over there.
Yeah, I feel so much better now.
I'm completely awake now.
Or maybe I should say I'm liberated.
That's all that happened! Nothing more...
This can't be happening!
Now I'm the one who's afraid?!
I have a message for the other Ants.
If you come anywhere near us,
your lives are over.
That's bull!
Very well.
Then don't bother.
They're gone.
Their stuff's still here...
Were other Ants nearby?
I don't sense any.
That means...
What are you doing?!
Eh? Can't you tell?
I'm punishing him.
Punishing him for toying with my feelings!
What the hell?
You're the one who's being unreasonable!
Well, at least he's okay...
Leave us alone!
This is none of your business!
Right back at you, stupid.
Why don't you make yourself scarce?
Why are you injured?
Huh?
Oh, I was training... Got a problem with it?
I'll injure you some more!
Palm...
Don't bother.
I could dodge your knife in my sleep.
I was so sure he was dead...
Wait!
I'll kill you!
What?
Catch us if you can, stupid!
Wait!
Stop, Killua...
You're just making her angrier.
Huh?
If we ditch her here, we'll never see her again.
We just have to call Knuckle and tell
him we'll meet him somewhere else.
I'm going back.
Do you want to die?
If you let your guard down,
thinking she's not much of a fighter,
she'll stab you in the back!
She wouldn't do that.
Huh?!
Bu— Didn't you see her take that knife to me?
Damn, you're too much!
They're making a fool of me!
They think they've escaped me?
Fools!
Wherever you run to, I will know!
Cute, cute mermaid...
Where is that accursed brat, Killua?
There he is, the fool!
The hotel by the station...
Brat...
Brat! Brat! Brat!
He keeps interfering!
If not for him, everything would be fine.
I'll chase him to the end of
the world and eliminate him!
Make a fool of me, will you?!
Kno—
Knov-sama...
Where did those boys go?
R-Right...
They went to the hotel that
has a logo with three circles.
This is Knov.
They're at the Triple Circle Hotel.
Yeah, we just got a call from them.
Um, I believe you had planned
to arrive in two days...
No, we're on schedule.
We'll use the extra two days
to observe those boys,
to determine if they're ready to
see Kite in his current state.
But first things first, Palm!
Y-Yes?
It appears that you used your
power without my permission.
I told you to await my orders,
in case of unforeseen events.
Yes...
Your blood is an irreplaceable commodity.
Irreplaceable?
Use it only for me.
Only for Knov-sama...
Understood?
Y-Yes.
Knov-sama really is the only one for me!
And why are you dressed like that?
Oh! No reason...
N-Nothing's going on!
Irreplaceable...
Then tell her to wait until
Kite's back to normal.
I did.
Gon Freecss, age 12, blood type B,
forced into a relationship by Palm
Siberia, age 22, blood type A...
and dumped before he knew it.
Meh... Again?
That's the third one.
Oh! A secret one!
Huh? Really?
Yeah, you can auction it on
the net for a lot of money.
Then you can have it.
Not interested.
Did something happen?
Hmm? Not really.
Let's hit the gym.
Okay!
Well?
Oh, I haven't noticed anything.
They seem to be doing fine...
But we should continue to observe them.
That will give them time to
conclude their business.
While Knov and Shoot were observing
the mental state of Gon and Killua...
He's here.
Who's this guy?
Not bad.
He's fast.
You're faster than the guys
I fought yesterday.
But not by much.
Next time: Grudge x And x Dread.
Give me more meat!
You eat a lot.
Bitter much?
You mean, "Jealous much?"
