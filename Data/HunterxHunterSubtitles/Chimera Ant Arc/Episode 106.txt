If you lose,
I shall take your left arm.
Well... Instead of my left arm...
Is it all right if I bet the thing I usually bet?
What?
What do you bet?
My life.
Your life, was it?
It appears I was the one lacking in resolve!
Accept this apology.
So this is it?
Our golden opportunity?
Yes...
Our chance to infiltrate the palace.
Knov x And x Morel
Neferpitou has stopped
using En, in order to heal the King's injury.
Knov takes this opportunity
to infiltrate the palace.
Finally, I've gotten this close.
Still more than one hundred meters
to the central stairway.
These strange trees bear very large fruit.
Around five hundred per tree...
And there are ten trees.
A total of five thousand.
Five hundred thousand people were to undergo
the selection process each day,
with a one-percent survival rate.
But thanks to Killua's distractions,
that schedule was only fulfilled on one day,
so the numbers add up...
These are cocoons holding the
humans who were selected.
Which means they will become Nen-wielding
human weapons at the King's disposal,
turning against the rest of humanity.
Neferpitou is probably a Manipulator...
and intends to manipulate these
soldiers per the King's will,
expanding his conquest throughout the world.
I will not let that happen!
First, the far exit... is set.
Next...
I must get closer.
The palace entrance looks dark...
So far, so good...
Middle exit... set.
Now for the near exit.
There aren't any guards...
I'd imagine only a select few are inside.
This will work.
If I've come this far,
I can reach the inner palace.
The throne room is on the third
floor, at the rear and center.
King
We must delay any reinforcements,
even if by only a second.
Central Stairway
The first floor is too far for that.
The central stairway, second floor.
That's the best location!
The central stairway is beyond this courtyard...
To be safe, I'll leave an exit here...
No, that would be no different
from the one outside...
It should at least
be next to the first floor's central stairway.
Then, if I can, I'll go up from
there to the second floor...
Window Opener
Scream
Scream...
Close!
Are any others around?
If I'm seen, it's over.
I'll have to retreat...
Nothing's coming?
Then it was alone?
This is it.
I can't move beyond this point...
If I do, I'll be killed.
What is that aura?
It appears to be full of all
kinds of misfortune...
At this point, I don't fear death.
What I fear is that,
before killing me,
the monsters up there
will squeeze every drop of information
from me that I have on the King...
Using any brutal means necessary.
If I'm caught, I won't be able to resist...
The aura's strength
just confirms it...
This is as far as I go...
Oh, aren't you that lion guy from TV?
My name is Leol, and don't forget it.
I heard that I should expect
a crayfish and wolf.
They're dealing with the grunts you created.
So I can fight you one-on-one.
I appreciate that.
This guy's just as strong as Cheetu.
No, he's a little stronger.
Let's get started.
Right now, allowing Knov to get
into the palace is the priority.
Until that happens, I need to
divert the enemy's attention.
That won't help.
This is Marcos.
Do you have the meat?
Yes, as requested.
Refrigerated trucks are entering
the underground warehouse...
They're shipping in food.
If the information Marcos
provided was accurate,
living women are also inside.
Not for the King, but for the
lecherous Secretary Bizeff.
If everything is going as planned,
Palm should be inside.
Leave the fourth truck as it is.
Yes, sir.
Then we'll be leaving.
Area D, of the underground warehouse.
My very own paradise, where no one can interfere.
Now, please step out.
There's nothing to worry about.
From now on, you will work here.
I've prepared rooms for each of you.
You will be provided with all necessities.
In your spare time, you may do as you want.
As long as you don't attempt to escape.
Your only job
is to follow my orders.
When summoned, you must drop everything,
and come to see me at once.
Yes, Mr. Secretary.
Excellent.
You...
Come with me.
Yes.
The rest of you can wait in your rooms.
Yes...
The Secretary was...
...interested in us!
I must find a way out of here,
so I can see the King and his Royal Guard.
Using her crystal ball, Palm can observe
the current whereabouts of
anyone she has seen previously.
This power will allow her to keep tabs
on the King and Royal Guard.
The Hunters will then be able to determine
the optimal route for the operation.
Only one exit.
I'll have to manipulate Bizeff.
My mission is crucial for
increasing our chances
of defeating the King!
What matters most isn't that I succeed...
But that, should I fail and be captured,
I kill myself immediately.
I should be safe here...
Palm...
Don't do anything foolish!
I managed to place the exits,
so even if your mission doesn't succeed,
we can still execute the operation.
If you get caught, it's over...
That...
That...
That vicious aura...
One look
was all it took
to break my will...
Gon... Killua...
You must have seen that aura...
You were probably even closer,
actually touching it...
Yet...
How are you still able
to face them?
How can you bring yourself to fight?
Is it to save your friends?
To protect humanity?
Why...
Why are you still fighting?
Palm!
Please...
Don't do anything foolish.
I beg you...
If you're caught, it's all over...
Palm!
I won't be able...
to go back there...
I brought you something cold to drink.
You're dismissed.
Wait in your room.
Yes.
Your lack of familiarity with the
area has sealed your defeat.
Though it's almost too perfect that,
after all that running,
you ended up in an underground church.
In case of emergency, this place
is used as an air shelter.
An ideal place to die in a vain struggle.
Well, you'll have to say your own prayers.
I'm an atheist.
You're a cocky guy.
Let's see who's trapped whom.
Cheetu told me everything.
I hear you can mold that
smoke into various objects.
Knowing that, he still chased me in here?
Even better.
If he believes things are going his way,
he won't hesitate to display his abilities.
However,
I've yet to meet anyone whose power
allows them to react more
flexibly than Deep Purple.
I can feel the tension in the air... I love it.
Both of us waiting to reveal our abilities...
I really dig it.
It's common sense to defeat an opponent
before they can use their power.
But that isn't how men
should fight.
Hey, what are you up to?
Voluntarily removing one of your senses?
Have you heard of the band Black Planet?
Their second album is super cool.
It's a twelve-song medley.
Listening to the whole thing's
like reading a good book.
When you finish it, you feel great.
I know.
And best part of all, the medley's
exactly sixty minutes long.
It's a masterpiece!
I hate to admit it, but I agree.
Rental, start!
This could be bad...
I have a hard time fighting
others who share my tastes.
Next time: Return x And x Retire.
Killua!
Return on.
Killua!
To the next episode preview!
It has to be you, Killua!
Hey, stop crying.
