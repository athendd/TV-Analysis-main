What? Intruders?
Dispose of them.
I'm busy right now.
Don't bother me with reports
I don't need to hear!
Carry on now.
Date x With x Palm
I don't know which nation sent you.
But having entered this palace,
you must now die painful deaths.
Your Majesty...
I needn't even strain my eyes to sense it.
This is a rare human.
An appetizing treat.
This is it...
This is the flavor I sought!
I feel it.
I feel it! I feel it!
This is it!
I can feel power surging through my body!
Nyow I understand...
This is the King's power.
He can take aura from rare humans he consumes.
In other words,
the more he eats, the stronger he will grow.
Hmm? Who are you people?
Guards!
What are you incompetents doing?
Worthless.
I can't sense anything.
Insolent thugs!
Do you know who I am?
A supreme leader of this era,
a king among kings...
I am Masador Diego!
Why does that scum claim to be the king?
In the human world, it is a common phenomenon.
Humans without intelligence or talent
end up in positions of power due
to bloodline or connections.
That defies all logic...
In the hands of an incompetent,
power brings nothing but ruin.
This could only be the work of imbeciles.
We must provide proper guidance.
Absolutely.
However, they serve as quality meat,
and they are a self-renewing resource.
They are an easy food source.
The non-rare humans can be
used to feed our soldiers.
I shall use my godly power
to deal divine punishment!
Leave at once—
Allow me to dispose of this.
I can use it to control other humans.
Do as you like.
P-Please!
S-Spare our lives.
We beg you...
These humans are idiots.
Think as hard as those weak
brains of yours can manage.
Have you ever spared a pig or a cow
as it begged for its life?
The view is excellent.
And there is plenty of space.
I dub this place the Meat Plantation.
It will be used for processing humans.
As you command.
After being defeated by Knuckle
and Shoot, Gon and Killua
return to the inn where Palm waits.
Before I worry about enemies,
I have to protect Gon from Palm.
You must take responsibility.
What?!
You promised to take me to NGL...
You said you'd swallow a thousand needles
if you broke that promise.
Uh-huh, I'm sorry.
I don't want an apology...
But there's no point in having you
swallow a thousand needles.
Yeah.
So what can I do to make up for it?
Let's see...
You must...
do any one thing I say.
Hey!
Right now, do you know how Gon feels—
Okay, I agree!
Go out with me.
Go out with me...
Eh?
Okay.
Huh?
Do you have any idea what you're doing?!
Yeah, but I did say I'd do anything.
And you have no problem
playing dirty like this?!
This is none of your business.
It's our problem.
It's up to the two of us.
You should stay away from her, Gon.
Don't interrupt us!
This is something the two
of us must decide alone.
You just want an excuse to say that!
Just be quiet.
We're going out now...
There's somewhere I really want to go.
Oh, sorry. I can't go out today.
Eh?
Today, I have to train with Killua.
I know!
You can train with us, Palm!
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Didn't you say we'd go out?
Uh-huh.
Then, why is he tagging along?
And why would we train?
Are you toying with me?
This will be a date...
Our first date!
The first date for us!
The! First! Date!
But it isn't a date.
Huh?!
We can have a proper date later.
Since it's our first date, like you said.
Wow...
The word "date" keeps popping up.
And I need time to prepare for it, too.
Prepare? Prepare for what?
That's...
a secret.
You get to find out tomorrow.
Oh...
In that case,
it's fine.
Really...
If you'd explained first,
I wouldn't have been so angry.
Sorry about that.
But I wanted to keep it secret, to surprise you!
You wanted to surprise me?
Gosh...
Let's meet tomorrow, at 10 AM,
in front of the bulletin board.
I'll be there!
Gon, you're amazing!
Huh? What do you mean?
Well, listening to you talk to Palm,
you seemed used to this stuff.
Really?
I was wondering...
Hmm?
Have you been on a date before?
Sure, I have.
Well, most of them were with Mito-san.
Oh, that makes sense...
Wait, who else was there?
Oh, some of the fishing boats
that stopped at Whale Island were full of women,
some of whom only liked younger men...
So I took them around the village
and had them teach me things.
T-Teach him things?
Th-That means...
He's a grown-up!
Women like that were called fanatics.
Haven't you ever been on a date, Killua?
No! Of course not...
I spent all my time training as an assassin.
And ever since I quit, I've been with you.
Oh, yeah.
Right!
And I really don't want that to change...
Somewhere down the line,
you'll leave Gon behind to die.
Damn, I'm about ready to give in...
And this was my own decision...
Hello?
It's Knuckle.
We've located and secured Kite.
Really? Kite's okay?
Knuckle?
I believe that Kite's being controlled by the enemy.
So I wouldn't say that he's okay.
That's fine.
There must be a way to bring him back!
All right, it'll take three days to get back,
so watch out for any soldier ants.
It seems they've scattered far
and wide, imitating the king.
Got it.
Yes!
I knew that Kite was alive!
That's great.
All that's left
is to protect you for a month.
Wow!
Look over here!
I've found a new feeding ground.
There we go.
What's that for?
It's a present for Palm.
Are you sure about this?
If you hand that to her, won't she freak out?
If I just hand it to her, probably...
Whatever... Let's get back to town.
Yeah.
If we encounter soldier ants
here, in the mountains,
we'll be in serious trouble.
Likewise, if we stay in town, the risk of
encountering ants looking for humans is high.
But while other humans are being
targeted, we can escape.
After all, Gon can't currently use his Nen...
So I must protect him.
Even if it means sacrificing everything else!
Let's hurry.
Drop your weapon,
place your hands behind your head,
and lie down on the ground!
If you don't comply within three
seconds, we will open fire.
Three...
Two...
One!
Ready...
Fire!
He disappeared?
Ow!
These guys are so slow...
This is no fun.
On to the next story.
Today, around noon,
an unidentified creature killed
seven people in Pata City.
The creature also injured multiple police
officers who had rushed to the scene,
before escaping into the Miera Mountains.
According to police testimony,
the creature moved at speeds exceeding
two hundred kilometers per hour.
Before leaving, it said, "I'll return
tomorrow. Bring faster humans,"
which means it could be a new
species of Magical Beast.
An evacuation has been ordered
for all area residents.
Pata City and the Miera Mountains...

Another city lies between us,
with the Miera Mountains on the opposite side.
We should be okay...
The government has requested that
the Hunter Association capture it,
and the Association has accepted.
Next, we have the weather.
I'm done, Killua!
Tomorrow, we're both on our own.
Yeah, I'll be training all day in the gym.
Yeah, right.
I can't ditch Gon when he's
essentially defenseless...
Gon-kun, over here.
Hmm?
I didn't recognize you!
Who are you?!
Do I look strange?
Nope, you look really pretty!
Wait, stop it... You're too loud.
You're embarrassing me...
What? I'm just telling the truth.
That's enough. Let's go.
Quickly.
Damn...
What am I doing?
Now I look like the stalker!
No, don't let it get to me.
I have to protect Gon!
There's no telling when
the enemy will show up.
How far are they going to go?
Something's there.
This aura is probably from a soldier ant.
It isn't that close,
but it isn't that far, either.
There are faint aura traces around.
Did it already pass through the area?
Or were they brought here by the wind?
Either way, there's a high
risk our paths will cross!
Should I warn them?
We're here.
Eh?
It's beautiful...
No,
there's no point in telling them.
Gon can't use his Nen.
If he gets upset about Kite and flies
off the handle with rage, he's finished.
Knowing Palm, she'll definitely
go nuts if I interrupt her date.
If she breaks the silence with her shrieks,
Use this chair.
the nearby ants will notice us.
Thank you, I'm fine.
I can't let them know...
I'll take care of this myself!
Oh, I thought I smelled a human...
That's...
I remember you.
You're one of those kids from before!
Looks like your luck's run out.
You're about to get a taste of hell.
But it won't last forever.
I moved upwind to catch his attention
and draw him away from them.
I've done what I had to.
But...
Where's the other kid?
Once you tell me his location,
I'll give you an easy death.
Well, he can't be that far away...
He's your buddy, right?
Well, it doesn't matter if you talk or not.
I'll just walk around making lots of noise
and swinging your severed head.
Then he'll come to me himself.
Isn't that how humans are?
He's right.
I have to defeat him,
or it's all over!
I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!
Next time: Friend x And x Journey.
Going back to Whale Island with Killua...
Looking up at the stars with Gon.
We're going on a journey!
