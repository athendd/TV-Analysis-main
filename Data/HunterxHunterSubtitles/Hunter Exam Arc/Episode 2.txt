Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Okay!
I'll take responsibility for bringing
you three to the port closest to the exam site.
Yay!
Test x Of x Tests
Dolle Harbor
After winning the captain's favor,
the trio of Gon, Kurapika, and Leorio
arrived safely at Dolle Harbor.
Thanks, Captain!
I had a great time!
I had fun, too.
Right! As a token of my appreciation,
I'll give you some advice.
Advice?
Look. See that big cedar tree on the hilltop?
Uh-huh.
You should make your way there first.
It's a shortcut to the exam site.
A shortcut?
Got it!
So, I just need to head for that tree!
I'll do that, Captain!
Thanks!
Best of luck!
Yep! Same to you!
Take care!
Rest easy, Ging.
Your son has grown into a respectable young man.
Huh... That's strange.
Why?
According to the notice I received,
the exam is supposedly being held
somewhere in Zaban City.
Right now, we're here.
That tree is in the opposite direction.
Perhaps you misheard him?
No, he told me to head toward that cedar tree.
I see...
And this notice isn't any help!
Where, exactly, in Zaban City
are we meant to go?
Our task is to find the exam site,
using a limited amount of information.
Just another test before we'll be allowed
to take the Hunter Exam.
I-I knew that...
I already knew that!
Anyway, I'll go have a look.
The captain must have had
a reason to suggest that.
Hey, hey...
You're serious?
The bus to Zaban is about to leave.
We should just take it.
Hey!
Man...
He's gotta learn that you
can't trust everyone.
Huh?
Hey!
Kurapika!
Gon's behavior interests me more
than the captain's advice.
I'm going with him.
Oh, is that so?
See ya.
Wasn't very long... Nice knowing you.
Guess he's not as independent as I'd thought...
I'm just gonna take the bus!
So it was a trap...
Seems none of the buses have
made it to Zaban City.
Rookies usually fail this part
because they're too na√Øve.
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait for me!
Well, I knew you guys would
be lonely without me.
And it's no fun traveling alone.
So I decided to stick with you
guys a while longer.
This is a creepy place...
I don't see a single person.
No, there are plenty here.
What?
Wh-What's with the freak show?
Exciting...
E-Exciting?
Exciting...
Exciting.
Exciting two-choice quiz!
You boys are headed for that
tree on the hill, correct?
To reach that tree,
you must pass through this town.
Huh?
I shall administer a single-question quiz.
H-Hold on!
What's going on here?
You'll have five seconds to state your answer.
Give the wrong answer, and you're disqualified.
You'll have to give up on taking
this year's Hunter Exam.
I see...
Then this is part of the Hunter Exam.
I see how it is.
I happen to be a quiz expert.
Wait. Only one question?
Your answer will be either the number 1 or 2.
Any other answer will be considered incorrect.
Hold on!
All three of us share one question?
So if one of them answers incorrectly,
I'm disqualified, too?
As if that would happen!
What scares me is the high likelihood
of the vice versa happening.
What was that?
But you know...
This way's easier, since only one of us
needs to know the answer.
I'm not good at quizzes.
I suppose...
Fair point.
Hey, there. Hurry it up.
Or else I'll answer the question first.
Who are you?
He followed us here, all the way from port.
Huh? Seriously?
Sorry, kid.
I happened to overhear your conversation.
What will you do?
He seems eager to take it.
We should let him go first.
That way, we'll know what kind
of question to expect.
I don't mind.
I have no objection.
Then I'll get to it.
Fools.
I'll leave a trail of traps behind me.
Here is your question...
Evil villains have captured your mother and lover.
You can only save one.
Select 1 for your mother, or 2 for your lover.
Which will you save?
H-How is this even a quiz?
The answer is 1.
Oh? Why do you say that?
Because you can't replace your mother.
But you can find another lover.
What?
You may pass.
What?
You just have to tell the old lady
what she wants to hear.
Adios.
Hey, now! That's all bull!
How was that the right answer?
We're supposed to give the answer
the old lady wants?
And that's considered correct?
Hey, say something!
I won't put up with this sham.
I'll find a different route.
It's too late.
Refuse to take the quiz, and you're disqualified.
Th-That's just ridiculous!
Different people would expect different answers!
There is no right answer!
No right answer...
I see!
Leorio!
Wait!
The cat-eyed boy has figured it out.
Not another word from you.
Say anything but the answer,
and you're immediately disqualified.
Wake up, Leorio...
It's a simple trick...
Gon...
Here is your question...
Your son and daughter have been kidnapped.
You can only rescue one.
Select 1 for your son, or 2 for your daughter.
Which will you rescue?
She's making fun of us...
Five.
Go ahead and count down, you hag.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Buzz. Time's up.
Don't stop me, Kurapika!
I won't be satisfied until I've
taught this hag a lesson!
Calm down, Leorio!
How am I supposed to calm down?
You'll waste our correct response.
Correct response?
We gave the right answer.
Silence was the correct response.
Silence? What do you mean...
You hit the nail on the head.
There is no right answer!
Precisely.
This quiz had no right answer.
However, we could only state
1 or 2 as the answer.
In other words, we weren't meant
to respond at all.
Silence was the only response.
But what about that other guy?
They never said he gave the right answer.
She only said, "You may pass."
In other words, this path is the wrong path.
Am I right?
Precisely.
The correct path is over here.
This leads directly to the tree.
Walk two hours, and you'll reach the top.
Oh, so that's what this was about...
A couple lives in the cabin beneath that tree.
They serve as Navigators.
If you meet their standards, I believe that
they will guide you to the exam site.
Gran, I'm sorry for my rudeness.
Don't be. I don't mind.
I do this job because I enjoy
meeting people like you.
Huh?
Do your best to become a good Hunter.
It's no use. I can't think of an answer.
You were still trying to find an answer?
You can stop.
Huh? Why?
The quiz is over.
I know.
But...
But you know...
What if I run into a situation like that
and I can only save one person...
What should I do then?
It wouldn't be right to choose just one...
But one day, I might have
to make that choice.
That's right.
That is the true purpose of this test.
You must be prepared to face the
worst possible scenarios...
Because harsh reality strikes without warning.
You must be prepared for
the day your paths diverge.
Hunter Vocabulary
Kurapika
It's totally dark out...
"Walk two hours," she said?
It was two hours, two hours ago!
Damn.
Beware of Magical Beasts!
Another "Beware of Magical Beasts" sign?
Are we ever gonna make it to the exam site?
I'm hungry!
I need to take a dump!
Leorio!
We'll leave you behind!
I've gotta take a leak, too!
I see it.
Hey!
Hello? Anyone home?
Are they out?
We're coming in.
It's a Magical Beast!
A Magical Beast?
A Transforming Magical Beast, the Kiriko!
They can take human form!
That's an extremely intelligent creature!
There's a woman in his arms!
And the guy on the floor
needs medical attention...
P-Please...
Please save my wife...
Leorio, we'll leave the injured man to you!
Got it!
He can follow that faint shadow,
even through this dark forest.
Impressive.
Kiriko! Let her go!
Take her from me, if you can!
Wow! He can talk!
That Magical Beast,
the Kiriko, uses human speech.
Oh. That makes this a lot easier!
Hey! Silly Kiriko!
What?
H-He's fast!
Kurapika!
He's so reckless...
Stupid kid.
You'll pay for this!
Wait!
Are you okay?
Are you injured anywhere?
I'm okay.
What about my husband?
How is he?
Don't worry.
Our friend is taking care of him.
Please take me to my husband!
Those tattoos...
You're...
Kurapika!
You okay?
Leorio?
Whew... Guess you guys are all right.
How is that man?
Yeah, no worries.
The wound wasn't as deep as it looked.
I gave him some painkillers,
and he's sound asleep in the cabin.
I see...
How did you know?
How did you know I was an impostor?
I didn't think that you were.
I told Leorio to take care of the
injured man, and he consented.
Given the Magical Beast is still on the loose,
I attacked you for foolishly leaving
an injured man on his own.
That's all.
Now I need you to answer my question.
Who are you?
Wait!
For a kid, you're pretty quick.
Didn't expect you'd land a blow on me.
You're about to discover
the high price that accomplishment came with!
Who are you?
You aren't the one I hit.
Are you his friend?
How can you tell that I'm not the same one?
Huh?
Your face is completely different.
And your voice is a little higher and thinner.
What?
Did I say something funny?
Hey, sweetheart!
Come out here!
You're gonna love this!
Hmm...
How many years has it been since someone
was able to tell us apart?
I'm ecstatic!
Can you tell their faces and
voices are different?
No, not at all...
You see, the one Kurapika and I
beat up is the husband.
Which one are you talking about?
Allow us to introduce ourselves.
We are the Navigators.
Our family provides support
for the Hunter Exam.
I'm their daughter!
I'm their son!
Man, you had us fooled.
The Hunter Exam changes site every year.
It's quite difficult to locate it.
So we Navigators help by guiding
the applicants to the site.
Oh, that's how it works.
But we don't help every candidate.
We test applicants to see if they're qualified
to take the exam.
Kurapika-dono.
Yes.
You successfully used the most vague of hints
to determine that we weren't spouses.
The hint was these tattoos
which, in this region,
mark a woman as single for life.
Kurapika-dono demonstrated that
he is very knowledgeable.
Therefore, he passes.
Way to go, Kurapika.
Thanks.
Leorio-dono.
Yeah...
You never realized my true identity.
However, you dressed my injuries
faster and more thoroughly than any doctor.
Most importantly, you continued
to reassure me
that my wife was safe.
S-Stop it...
It's embarrassing...
Your kindness makes you worthy
to take the Hunter Exam.
Thus, you pass.
R-Really?
Thank goodness...
You did it!
And finally, Gon-dono.
Yes!
Your superhuman physical ability
and powers of observation
make you worthy to take the Hunter Exam.
You pass.
We will now take you to the exam site.
Isn't it great that we all passed?
It's too early to celebrate.
We've merely earned the right
to take the real exam.
What's wrong with celebrating a little?
We're making progress.
Honestly, you people really should think.
Hey! Why must you be such a smart-ass?
Stop moving around!
If you fall, blame yourself!
Gon and his friends enjoy a brief
journey through the sky.
However, they still haven't reached
the starting line.
Next time: Rivals x For x Survival.
I'm going to do my best!
