Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
How wonderful...
I really do love that look.
But I was pretty excited, as well.
I was so scared, I wanted to run away.
But I couldn't.
And at the same time, I was excited.
Isn't that strange?
A x Surprising x Challenge
Looks like we made it in time.
Leorio...
Leorio!
Man, that stings...
Why am I all beat up?
Huh?
My memory is kinda hazy.
We probably shouldn't tell
him what happened.
Yeah...
Gon.
Killua!
I can't believe you actually got here...
I thought you were done for.
I just tracked Leorio's cologne.
Cologne?
That was how?
You definitely are weird.
Excellent work, everyone.
Phase Two of the exam will occur here,
in the Biska Forest Park.
So, I shall take my leave.
Best of luck to all of you.
Will all applicants who passed
the First Phase please enter?
Welcome.
I'm Menchi, the Second Phase examiner.
And I'm Buhara, the other examiner.
Wh-What was that sound?
You must be hungry.
I'm starving...
There you have it.
Phase Two will involve...
...cooking!
C-Cooking?
Wait! Cooking?
We're here to take the Hunter Exam!
That's quite right.
Your challenge for the Second Phase is to produce
a dish that will satisfy our palate.
Why do we have to cook?!
That's because
we are Gourmet Hunters.
Huh?
Man, what a letdown.
They're Gourmet Hunters...
The Gourmet Hunters Menchi and Buhara...
Their selection as examiners
could prove problematic.
Only fifty applicants...
No, depending on the task,
it's possible that fewer than ten
applicants will pass Phase Two.
So, Gourmet Hunters,
what are we supposed to make?
Buhara.
The required ingredient is pork.
Pork?
As in pig meat?
You're free to use meat from any
species of Biska Forest pigs.
You must use the cooking facilities here
to prepare the pork.
And you only pass if we both
find it delicious.
And we will evaluate more
than just the taste.
Don't underestimate the
intricacies of cooking.
Got it?
When we've both eaten our fill,
the exam will end.
We get it. We get it.
Let's just start.
Then, the exam's Second Phase
begins now!
Free to use meat from any species of pigs?
You have a real nasty streak.
Choosing the ingredients was my job.
Only one species of pig lives in
the Biska Forest, correct?
I hope they don't get themselves killed.
Hey, little piggy?
Catch a pig and cook it.
This is way easier than the First Phase.
I hope it will be that simple...
What was that about, Gon?!
Found them.
Huh?
Pigs!
Uh... They're chewing on bones.
Don't tell me...
They're carnivores?
Huh?
What's that?
These pigs are crazy!
The Great Stamp,
the world's most ferocious pig.
They use their large, stout noses
to send their enemies flying.
If you're too slow, you'll end up
as their dinner.
Take that!
What?
Huh?
Just maybe...
Could their foreheads be
their weak points?
So, the pigs evolved large,
strong noses in order to protect
their soft foreheads.
Oh, my. They caught a lot.
This year's applicants are very talented.
However, the difficult part is yet to come.
Now eat the pig and send me
to the next phase.
Okay, it's evaluation time.
Taste testing.
Tastes good!
It's overcooked.
The tough texture ruins the
flavor of the meat.
What? You haven't even tried it!
It's plain as day.
Damn it...
Okay... Dive in!
Huh? Why?
Charred on the outside,
uncooked inside.
Your fire was too strong.
Honestly...
All they're doing is roasting the whole pig,
like it's all they know how to do...
None of them has made any effort!
No one's passed yet...
And Menchi hasn't even taken a bite...
Hey!
Can't anyone out there satisfy me?
That's it!
This phase of the exam is a cooking test,
but they're judging us on originality
and powers of observation.
I see...
How do you like my cooking?
Is this supposed to be a kiddy meal?!
I'm next!
It's basically the same thing!
I am next!
Please judge my creation.
Finally, something that
resembles an actual dish...
The point is to use the provided
facilities and ingredients
to highlight the main feature, the pork.
In other words, the taste is insignificant!
Yuck!
Huh?
Appearance is important,
but only if it also tastes good.
You're no better than #403!
Too bad!
No better than #403...
That was so much food,
I'm stuffed!
Yeah, I'm stuffed, too.
Therefore, no one passes.
We're finished here!
It's over?
What the hell?
As I expected, she's lapsed back
into her old bad habits.
What should we do, Chairman?
I suppose I have no choice.
Fine, I'll have to go in person.
Hunter Vocabulary
Menchi
Zero people passed?
Are you serious?
Does she really mean it?
The exam is over?
This isn't funny!
I won't accept it...
I absolutely refuse to accept this!
In the end, you've still failed.
Stop screwing around!
You asked for pork,
so we risked our lives toâ€”
I said to prepare the pork in a manner
we both found delicious...
None of you made anything
remotely delicious.
You all did almost the same thing.
There was no effort made...
Just when I thought someone actually tried,
they only changed the appearance.
No one attempted to emphasize the flavor.
I'm positive that none of you
took cooking seriously!
Pork dishes are all the same...
Just say that once more.
Any more crap from you,
and I'll shove my arm up your ass
and knock your teeth out!
Don't you mess with me!
There's Menchi's bad habit again...
I don't want any lip from a bunch of
After all, only a handful of chefs
amateurs who can't even roast a pig!
in the entire world can satisfy Menchi.
Hey! What did you just say?
Why don't you repeat it to my face?!
In other words, you people
don't have the guts to try anything new.
Shut up!
I'm not trying to become
a cook or a gourmet...
I want to be a Hunter!
Yeah! Yeah!
My goal is to become a Black List Hunter.
I refuse to let a mere Gourmet Hunter
decide my fate!
Too bad you got stuck with a mere
Gourmet Hunter as an examiner...
Better luck next year?
Why, you...
Don't mock me!
Buhara, don't interfere.
Well...
If I hadn't intervened,
you'd have killed him, right?
Probably.
Let me clarify this...
We frequently venture into the dens
of ferocious beasts,
searching for ingredients.
Every Hunter knows some form
of martial art.
You lack focus and the willingness
to experiment.
That alone disqualifies you
from becoming Hunters!
That said,
it would be excessive to fail
every single applicant.
That's the symbol of the
Hunters Association!
Is it someone from the
Selection Committee?
Wh-Who's that geezer?
The Chairman of the
Selection Committee.
He's in charge of the Hunter Exam...
Chairman Netero.
Well, I work behind the scenes.
I only take action when there's
an issue, like now.
So, Menchi-kun...
Yes, sir.
You failed all of the applicants because
you disapproved of their reluctance
to try new things?
No, sir...
I lost my cool when one
of the candidates
insulted Gourmet Hunters.
And I made the exam harder
than necessary.
In other words, you're aware that
this exam was unacceptable.
Yes, sir.
When cooking is involved,
I lose control.
I'm unqualified to be an examiner.
I will resign as examiner,
so please redo the Second Phase!
But it would be difficult to find
another examiner on such short notice.
I apologize...
Very well. How about this?
I'd like you to continue serving
as an examiner.
But you must also participate
in the new test you propose.
Is that acceptable?
I'm certain that will help
the applicants to accept the results.
That's true...
Then the new challenge will be
boiled eggs!
Boiled eggs?
Chairman, can you take us
to Mt. Split-in-Half
in your airship?
Mt. Split-in-Half?
I see what you're doing.
Certainly, I can.
Now, everyone...
Look down there.
Wh-What is that?
A Spider Eagle's web.
They build webs down there?
Look below the web.
Those are...
Those are Spider Eagle eggs.
Spider Eagles build their webs in deep ravines,
to protect their eggs from predators.
This makes their eggs
one of the most difficult
ingredients to obtain.
The eggs are also known as dream eggs.
W-Wait a minute...
You don't mean we...
I sure do.
What?
Even if she can grab some eggs,
how will she climb back up?
Hey... She jumped down!
Is she trying to kill herself?
No, she's not.
Huh?
That looks fun...
This ravine has updrafts
that help the hatched chicks
fly up to the web.
There. Now I just need to boil the egg.
Y-You must be joking.
No reasonable person would
jump down there...
I've been waiting for this!
Okay! Count me in!
Wait!
I haven't finished explaining everything!
Catch you later.
Let's go!
Not yet.
Why not?
There's no wind.
There isn't always an updraft.
When's the next one?
Wait.
What?
The web won't hold us all!
Gon, not yet?
Damn, I can't wait for an updraft!
It's gonna snap!
Now!
And the rest of you?
I guess you quit.
It takes courage to concede, too.
This is damned good.
Much better than the eggs
you buy in a store...
I can see why they're
called dream eggs.
Hey, Todo-san.
Would you like a bite?
It's delicious...
Now you've experienced the joy
of discovering
how good something can taste.
We're risking our lives for that joy.
I was completely outclassed this year.
I'll be back next year!
The applicants have learned that,
whether you're a Black List Hunter
or a Gourmet Hunter,
calling yourself a Hunter requires an
enormous amount of determination.
Only 42 applicants remain.
Next time: Showdown x On The x Airship!
Use soap when you wash your hands!
R-Right!
