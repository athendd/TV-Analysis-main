Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...
Vast riches... Hidden treasures...
Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...
The word "unknown" holds magic.
And some incredible people are
drawn to that magic.
They are known...
...as Hunters!
Consider this a warning...
First,
a real Phantom Troupe tattoo has the
member's number on the spider.
Second,
they don't bother counting
how many they've killed.
Third,
never mention the Troupe again.
If you do,
I'll kill you.
Trick x To The x Trick
Leorio has volunteered for
the fourth round.
If he wins, the group's victory is assured.
But can he win?
Okay!
I'll finish up the job.
Toss that guy out, and send in
your next competitor!
We can't do that.
What's that?
We can't move him yet,
because his match hasn't been settled.
The match hasn't been settled?
What do you mean?
He's still alive.
He was only knocked out.
Did you forget?
This was a death match.
The fight doesn't end until one
contestant surrenders or dies.
He's still alive, and he
hasn't surrendered.
Tsk... Damned technicalities!
But she's right.
I agree.
I see...
Hey, Kurapika!
Go finish off that worthless trash.
I refuse.
Huh?
Why?!
The fight is over.
He'd already lost his will to fight
when I punched him.
I will not fight someone who's lost.
Screw that!
Then what do we do?
They're claiming that the
match hasn't ended!
Let him handle it.
Huh?!
Once he wakes up,
we'll have our answer.
Hey, now...
We only have so much time left.
We can't afford to just sit and wait!
I have no intention of killing him!
Come on!
Hey...
If you don't want to dirty
your hands, I'll do it.
Killua?
You haven't ever killed
anyone before, right?
Are you scared?
I have never considered whether
murder is frightening.
But this is a one-on-one battle.
You aren't permitted to interfere.
Okay, then...
But we're working as a team,
so you shouldn't be too selfish.
Oh!
You do say useful things sometimes!
Keep it up!
Don't you understand that you're
screwing up our chances?
I'm sorry, but I won't change my mind.
You stubborn fool...
Fine!
A majority decision...
O to kill him,
and X to leave him alive.
Ready, and...
Why isn't it working?!
Maybe it's because we're
asking the question?
Huh?
The watches only work for questions
presented by the examiners.
I see...
Okay!
Then we'll use a show of hands!
Those who agree that he
should be finished off...
Now!
You traitor...
Weren't you just lecturing
Kurapika with me?
We're supposed to be a team...
A team!
But it's pointless!
He's not gonna change his mind.
Hey, Gon!
Why do you oppose killing him?
Kurapika's right.
He was on the verge of surrendering.
Let's wait for him to wake up.
We don't know how long
that will take.
I should just...
You shouldn't force others to do things.
Different people have different
circumstances and ideals.
No one asked your opinion.
Hey...
A majority ruling implies that you're
asking everyone's opinion.
Damn it! Fine!
Do whatever you want!
Leorio...
Man, what's wrong with these people?
Now he's sulking.
None of this matters if we can't even progress.
Don't you people get it?
Just leave him alone.
Fools...
They've fallen for the trap
of the majority decision.
You would expect it to be easier
for five people who've just met
to make decisions by majority rule.
While this method appears to
revere each individual opinion,
in actuality, it suppresses the minority.
When a person consistently finds himself
in the minority,
his opinion is always rejected.
His alienation,
anger, and discontent lead to antagonism.
Eventually, the team dissolves.
After all, we're rivals in
this Hunter Exam.
None of us would just
stand by and watch,
as our chances were hurt
by someone else's dumb mistakes.
But having been caught up in
the spirit of this test,
he's begun using majority decision
in unrelated situations.
And he made the mistake of holding
a discussion before the vote.
He even used majority decision in its
worst form, a public show of hands.
Unlike when people press the buttons
of their own watches,
everyone knows who diverged
from the majority.
So the minority can't even
protest the decision.
When someone feels they have no say,
and that their opinions are
constantly rejected,
the group breaks down.
In this case,
it means all five of us will fail the exam.
It's just a matter of time.
The atmosphere on the
other side is gloomy.
I've been waiting for you...
...Hisoka.
I'm not an examiner this year.
I'm here for revenge.
Since last year's exam,
all I've focused on was killing you.
Today, I'll get payback
for my scars!
Hmph.
Those scars merely show that you
were an incompetent examiner.
You're blaming me for your
own inadequacies.
Keep yapping!
Prepare to die.
Dual wielding?
Infinite quad wielding!
Take this...
It's not over yet!
Up, down, left, right.
Front and back...
You have nowhere to run!
You'll be cut from every angle,
by my endless stream of blades.
Dodging my infinite attack waves
is impossible!
I'll have you writhe in pain...
...until you die, Hisoka!
It would indeed be difficult
to dodge your attacks.
Thus, I should simply stop the blades.
Impossible...
It took me over half a year
to master catching those blades!
Oh...
It was easier than anticipated.
I appreciate your futile efforts.
Damn it!
Hunter Vocabulary
Hisoka
Hisoka, applicant #44, is the first
to pass the Third Phase.
Total time, six hours and
seventeen minutes.
Tsk...
Is something wrong, Gon?
Uh-huh.
I get it...
Hey...
It's quite possible that
he's already dead.
What's that?
Well, it's been several hours,
and he hasn't moved an inch.
Damn...
It's too far away for us to tell.
Hey! We want to check his body!
What's that?
He could already be dead.
I already told you,
he's only unconscious.
How many hours has it been?
I can't just take your word for it!
Then let's make a bet.
A bet?
On what?
On whether he's dead or alive.
What would we wager?
Time.
Time?
We will settle our match through
a betting game, a gamble.
And we'll use time, rather than chips.
Look at the monitor on the wall.
We each have fifty hours.
However, we can only wager
multiples of ten.
We continue placing bets until one
of us has no hours left.
A match where we gamble time...
We'll take turns deciding
what to bet on.
If you end up with zero hours,
your time limit will also be
shortened by fifty hours.
And if you end up with zero hours?
Our sentences will be
extended by fifty years.
If these terms are acceptable,
I'll check whether he's still alive.
Leroute...
Serving a 112-year sentence
for endangered species trafficking
and illegal gambling.
This match sounds like
her kind of game.
Man, this chick is whack.
She's willing to risk extending
her own sentence.
Consider your answer carefully, Leorio.
If you lose, we'll have
fifty fewer hours
with which to escape the tower.
You shouldn't talk...
After all, this is your fault,
for not finishing him off!
Fine!
I won't say another word!
Hey, we shouldn't fight
amongst ourselves!
Keep fighting, keep fighting...
Right!
I accept!
Okay! I chose our first bet,
so you can decide how
many hours we'll wager
on whether he's alive or dead.
I bet ten hours that he's alive.
What's this?
You were the one whining
over his being dead.
Very well. Then let's check.
You're being pretty cautious...
Weren't you going to not
say anything else?
Ten hours, huh?
This was the obvious choice.
Even if I'm wrong,
as long as we confirm his death,
Kurapika will have won his round.
If he's really unconscious,
I'll just kick his ass.
See? He's only unconscious.
So it seems.
All right...
Leorio has the lead!
This is bad.
Huh?
It's possible he isn't going to wake up.
What do you mean?
Remember when that woman
walked near the guy on the floor?
What of it?
I thought then
that he was already dead.
But on second thought,
they'd obviously prefer him alive,
but remaining unconscious.
If he doesn't wake up
before the test ends,
it shortens their sentences
by seventy-two years.
So if he doesn't wake up...
That's my point!
That's been their intention all along.
Well, it's your turn.
Decide what we'll bet on.
Let's see...
How about we bet on whether
he's truly unconscious?
Huh?
I see.
Hey, what am I supposed to do?
The note didn't cover this.
When I woke up, a note next to me
told me to feign unconsciousness,
and to hide the note in my mouth.
I understood the plan immediately.
If I can buy time by pretending
to be asleep,
our sentences will be shortened
by seventy-two years!
So, then what do I do?
Should I stay down?
Very well.
I bet twenty hours that he
really is unconscious.
Okay, got it...
I'm supposed to keep acting
like I'm unconscious!
But how do we confirm whether
he's really unconscious?
Oh...
That's simple.
This guy's heavy...
I'll just toss him off the edge.
Wh-What the hell?!
If he's actually unconscious,
he'll fall to his death.
Are you insane?
His match hasn't been settled yet.
We can't accept those terms.
Don't worry.
If he falls and dies,
we'll forfeit the match,
which will give you two wins.
Is that satisfactory?
Yes,
it is.
What was that?
Don't be ridiculous...
We're talking about my life here!
But then I'm changing my wager.
I bet forty hours that he
isn't unconscious.
Everything I have left.
Heh, little sneak.
Finally showing your true colors.
Then, I'll let go of him.
Whoa! Wait!
I'm awake! I'm awake...
Don't let go!
Wait! Whoa...
I'm gonna fall!
Good morning.
You people are crazy.
I've had enough!
I'll take the loss!
Forget the sentence reduction!
It's safer in prison...
You knew that he was awake.
I actually aspire to become a doctor.
All I had to do was check
his eye movement.
However, you're down
to twenty hours.
But now we have a 2-1 lead.
Now...
It's your turn!
What do you want to bet on?
Majitani surrenders,
giving Gon and his friends a 2-1 lead.
However, in the time-betting match,
they're down 80-20.
What will Leroute choose to bet on?
Next time: Trouble x With The x Gamble!
Bulldog... Bulldog...
Bulldog scramble!
