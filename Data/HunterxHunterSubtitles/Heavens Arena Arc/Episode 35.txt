Shroud
Ten.
The ability to build up a shroud of Nen aura.
You can make your body harder,
and considerably slow the effects of aging.
Null
Zetsu.
A technique that nullifies your Nen aura.
It is effective for concealing your presence,
and recovering from extreme fatigue.
Enhance
Ren.
A technique to create an
especially strong Nen aura.
This ability is crucial for increasing your power.
Act
Hatsu.
The release of your Nen aura,
after boosting via Ren.
These four elements are known
as the four major principles,
Four Major Principles
and are critical to the mastery of Nen.
Yes, that truly was impressive.
I can see the progress you've made
from these last two fights.
Feel free to pick a time and place...
I shall be your opponent.
The x True x Pass
Gon has obtained Hisoka's consent to fight him,
so he continues to train hard in Nen to prepare.
Today, we will finally begin to train in Hatsu.
Act
Once you master Hatsu,
you will have learned the basic Nen principles.
After that, you will need to work
on developing your individual Nen style.
Osu!
Hatsu is the technique
by which you control your Nen.
It is the culmination of Nen,
and there are six distinct categories.
Enhancer
Enhancers are able to strengthen objects.
Emitter
Emitters can propel their aura.
Transmuter
Transmuters can alter their aura's qualities.
Conjurer
Conjurers are able to manifest their aura.
Manipulator
Manipulators can use their aura
to control objects and creatures.
Specialist
Specialists are those with a
special aura that doesn't fall
within the other five classes.
The key is to find the power that suits you.
Enhancer
Emitter
Transmuter
Conjurer
Manipulator
Specialist
The power that suits you?
Nen is linked to individual ability,
with two areas of particular prominence.
The first would be your natural potential.
The second would be potential
refined later in life.
Gon-kun, for example,
was born with a flexible, springy body.
His acute senses were the product
of a childhood spent in nature.
From the moment of birth, your Nen aura
falls within one of the six categories.
While rare, it is possible for your
Nen aura to later change types.
If you attempt to learn an ability
that does not fit your inclination,
you will find it very difficult.
Act
Enhancer
Transmuter
Conjurer
Specialist
Emitter
Manipulator
This hexagon depicts the relationship
among the six categories.
The closer a class is to your own,
the higher your compatibility to learn it.
If you are born with an aura
of the Enhancer category,
you will find Enhancer abilities easiest
to learn and master.
And the adjacent Transmuter and Emitter classes
will also be easy to learn.
On the other hand, the Specialist class,
which is furthest away, would be difficult.
To illustrate, I'll use skills
that you've seen for yourselves.
Hisoka was able to change
his aura into a rubbery substance.
This would be a Transmuter ability.
Gido used his tops and body as
weapons by making them spin faster,
which would be an Enhancer power.
However, since using so many tops as weapons
also requires Manipulator skill,
he wasn't as successful.
As for Kastro,
his Tiger Bite was incredibly strong.
Had he mastered it, he would have
been among the strongest Nen users.
I believe that his aura fell
into the Enhancer class.
However, he focused his energy on
the power to create a double,
which is a Conjurer skill.
And he also required a Manipulator
ability to control the double.
Both of those are relatively far
from the Enhancer category.
So neither was compatible
with an Enhancer type?
Indeed, it requires a great deal of work and
natural talent to learn an incompatible ability.
And as a result,
he squandered most of his Nen potential.
So he made the wrong choice.
He was a great fighter...
It's a shame.
Well?
Do you see the importance
of understanding your own
auras and inclinations?
Osu!
Given that,
is there any way to learn which
category your aura falls into?
There is.
Water Divination,
a Shingen-ryu technique for classifying your aura.
It's also used in Hatsu training.
You place your hands beside
the cup, and use Ren.
The result will reveal your category.
The water's overflowing...
If the amount of water changes,
that means you are an Enhancer.
This shows that my aura falls
within the Enhancer class.
Okay, now it's your turn.
Gon's an Enhancer, too?
The leaf moved!
If the leaf moves, that makes you a Manipulator.
Okay, I'm last!
Nothing's happening.
Indeed...
The leaf isn't moving.
Do I not have any potential?
Not at all.
Taste the water.
Taste it?
It might be a little sweet...
You're right.
Yes, it's a bit sweet.
Isn't this just water?
It's just water.
But the taste changed.
Because of Killua-kun's aura.
And that means?
You are a Transmuter.
Oh!
A Transmuter?
Now, you three know
how your auras are classified.
Use the next four weeks
to train hard, so the Water Divination
results become more pronounced.
Osu!

Hello?
This is Gon.
Ah, I have been waiting...
Have you decided when we should fight?
Yeah, July 10th.
That's the day!
Okay.
I can hardly wait...
June 22nd
June 30th
July 5th
Now, show me what you've
accomplished with your training.
Killua-kun, you're first.
Okay.
I'm done.
It's sweet!
Wow, it tastes like honey.
Excellent.
Zushi, you're next.
Osu!
This is the best I can manage...
That's fine.
But it won't be enough to pass.
You'll need to train some more.
Osu.
Gon-kun, you're next.
Osu!
Stop...
Stop, Gon-kun!
The water increased with so
much force, it cracked the glass.
Honestly...
You really are something.
I was feeling pretty good about this.
Gon-kun, Killua-kun.
Today is your graduation day.
Huh?
Really?
We did it, Killua!
Yeah.
Master, what about me?
You still need to train a bit more.
Osu.
Keep at it.
You can do it!
Osu...
And, Gon-kun...
Huh?
I have something important to tell you.
Something important?
Gon Freecss-kun, you have passed
the Secret Hunter Exam!
Huh?
You've passed.
Congratulations.
The Secret Hunter Exam?
Correct.
You were able to pass.
What do you mean?
You are required to learn Nen
before becoming a Hunter,
as professional Hunters are
expected to be exceptionally strong.
One of your basic tasks
as a Hunter will be apprehending
evil poachers and criminals.
You must be strong enough to fight crime.
However, this power is highly
destructive when used for wrongdoing.
Revealing the existence of Nen
during the Exam would be dangerous.
Therefore,
the test is only administered to
those who pass the public Exam.
Oh, so you were going to teach us,
or at least Gon, all along...
Yes.
I should mention that the
head Shingen-ryu master
is Chairman Netero.
The master has told me much about you.
That old man...
Killua-kun.
Please take the Hunter Exam again.
You will definitely pass next time.
Huh?
Yeah.
You are more than qualified.
I guarantee it.
Yeah, if I feel up to it.
Hey, Wing-san...
Have you heard anything about
the others who passed?
Sure.
Hanzo and Kurapika
have learned Nen from other teachers.
Pokkle is struggling with Ren.
Leorio has begun studying for
the medical school exam.
Hisoka and Illumi already knew Nen,
so they were qualified.
Then Kurapika and Leorio are working hard.
Yeah.
Now, Gon-kun,
I have one warning for you.
When you fight Hisoka tomorrow,
don't push yourself too hard.
All right?
Yes, sir!
Zushi, you will continue
training for four more weeks.
Osu...
You should have more confidence.
You are progressing at an incredible pace.
You're a one-in-a-hundred-thousand talent.
One in a hundred thousand?
O-Osu!
However,
those two are one-in-ten-million talents.
Osu!
That doesn't make me feel any better, master...
But...
One day,
I will definitely catch up!
Hello, everyone!
In the arena today, we have Gon versus Hisoka.
This is the fight you've all been waiting for.
As you can see, the stands are packed.
The tension in the air before the
start of this match is almost unreal!
How much longer?
Get this thing started!
Gon is the first to arrive!
After four fights, he has a 3-1 record.
He's on a roll!
You can do it, Gon!
Don't you need your fishing rod?
You can't catch Hisoka with your bare hands!
And next, with a fiery display...
Hisoka appears!
His lethal battle with Kastro is still fresh
in everyone's minds.
His record is 9-3.
If he wins, he can challenge a Floor Master.
If he loses, he falls all the way down.
However, he has yet to lose
when he steps into the ring!
Will his undefeated record continue?
Oh...
Don't look at me like that.
Schwing
I'm getting turned on.
What a sinister aura.
Gon-kun, don't overdo it.
Points and KO system.
No time limit!
One round!
Begin!
This is the match you've been waiting for.
The die has been cast!
Who will make the first move?
It's Gon!
A clean hit!
One point to Hisoka!
Wh-What an intense exchange.
I never even got to sneak in a word!
What's wrong?
I still haven't moved a step from where I started.
Huh? Really?
Damn!
Just you wait!
Okay, I don't have to try to
hit him with every attack.
I can use some feints to get the same effect.
Hisoka's enjoying himself.
In terms of actual skill,
there's an insurmountable gap.
But he still has a weakness.
Hisoka knows that he's stronger,
so he won't retreat.
That gives Gon an opening!
In that case, I'll try that!
There it is!
Gon's Stone Flip!
He shattered the block to
create a hail of rubble.
Gon...
Where is he?
Gon has finally landed a solid hit on Hisoka.
However, he will soon receive a taste
of Hisoka's true power.
Brush Your Teeth.

Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Hisoka.
The reason Gon and Killua
began studying Nen.
He reels in opponents with rubbery Nen
called Bungee Gum,
and uses sticky Texture Surprise
A peculiar character,
who does things
to duplicate other objects.
like stick cards in
his own wounds.
