Chain Jail.
Chain Jail:
The Restraining Middle Finger
This power can only be used on the spiders...
A power to capture and
restrain the Phantom Troupe.
I've sworn to use this ability
for no other purpose.
I've applied the condition that,
should I use this technique
on one who is not a spider,
I will die on the spot.
A self-imposed restriction,
and a covenant with myself.
The proof of my resolve.
Restraint x And x Vow
After using Chain Jail
to capture Uvogin, Kurapika
and his fellow bodyguards flee by car.
We have cars behind us.
Someone check it out.
Indeed...
Think it's them?
Kurapika, floor it!
It's a tail!
A tail?
But who?
Could it be?
A thread!
Probably made of Nen.
There's something on his left thigh.
Damn!
They noticed it.
That was faster than expected.
Don't worry.
We've almost got them!
Whatever...
Why are we all stuffed in this tiny car?
It's just a little longer.
Fun Fun Cloth:
Convenient Magic Kerchief
What the hell?
Hey!
Let me out, damn it!
You guys really are good.
Given that you were
fast enough to open the door
and escape in moments.
I'll need to take care.
Nobunaga had an unlucky position...
Anyway, you have an interesting ability.
Let me out, damn it!
You can shrink anything merely
by using that cloth?
That would be quite handy for theft.
With that thing, you could fit all
of the treasure in your pocket.
Meaning that he's the one
who took the treasure
from the auction house.
And so, you can also restore
everything to its original size.
I believe the boss said he's named Owl.
His friends have arrived to help.
Yes...
There are quite a few of them.
Who are these guys?
Are they really Phantom Troupe members?
Yeah, definitely.
But they look so weak.
One, two, three...
Huh?
What's wrong?
There are ten total Shadow Beasts, right?
Uvo took care of four,
so this should be the rest.
That is strange.
The chain user grabbed Uvo,
before escaping by car.
Does that mean the chain
user isn't a Shadow Beast?
Well, we'll know once we ask them...
Should we keep them all alive?
No, we require only Owl.
Then I'll handle that.
Those damned kids are talking smack.
Let's show them how scary the
Shadow Beasts can be.
Did you hear that?
Shalnark, you just stand
there and watch.
I'll take three.
Shizuku can have the other two.
Got it.
Don't get cocky!
Keep your cool!
Don't underestimate their strength!
Shut up!
We lost them.
But what was it that I just saw
landing on the roof of their car?
Probably one of the
remaining Shadow Beasts.
This is our chance to
hurry back to the city.
Roger that.
We'll switch the location to pattern C.
And we don't want Muscles
here putting up a fight,
so we'll need muscle relaxants
and sleeping gas.
I hope those will work...
Move, and you'll get cut.
Okay, all done.
What about the bodies?
Just leave them.
No point hiding them now.
Okay, let's free Nobunaga
before we start torturing this guy.
Hold on.
We're taking Owl in the car with us, right?
There's no room, so let's
leave Nobunaga as he is.
Screw that! Let me out!
I don't want to be cramped, either.
Come on!
Hey, can you release the car alone?
I know you can hear me!
You're really making me mad!
Th-That's impossible...
Let me out, already!
Too bad.
So much for that...
Hey! What's going on?
You bastards were
making a fool out of me!
Troupe members aren't
supposed to snap at one other.
Shut up!
Anyway, this ability could come
in handy for our job.
Shut your mouth!
I'm cutting this guy to shreds!
No.
He's going to tell us
where the treasure is...
Feitan's going to use his skill at torture.
You just have bad luck.
Damn it!
Hey, wake up!
You understand
what's happening here?
Where did you put the
stolen merchandise?
What time is it?
How long have I been asleep?
It seems that you don't grasp
your current situation.
I'm asking the questions here!
Incredible mental fortitude...
He's well aware that he's
about to be tortured,
but the aura around his
body remains firm.
That iron body is built
on a rock-solid spirit.
That is why his aura is so strong.
The product of countless battles.

Can I move?
No...
I won't recover for a while.
I had dinner around 8.
Judging by my stomach,
it's around midnight now.
Let's make a deal.
I'll spare your lives, so let me up now.
Wh-What is he saying?
Is he insane?!
He's serious.
I think.
What? Are you crazy?
He's the one who should
be begging for his life.
Let me make something clear.
We're after the auction merchandise
that was stored underground.
If you guys don't know where it is,
I have no business with you.
What?
Wait a moment.
You didn't steal the merchandise?
The safe was empty when we arrived.
The Shadow Beasts had
already taken it all.
I guess they didn't bother
telling grunts like you.
I don't think he's lying...
Then he's serious?
When he offered to make a
deal, he wasn't bluffing?
Everyone makes mistakes...
We haven't stolen anything yet.
So take these off,
and pretend you didn't see anything.
If you do that,
you get to live!
What about the guests?
Guests?
The guests who were in the auction hall.
Some of our colleagues were there.
Answer me.
I see.
That's too bad...
We killed them.
It was part of our planâ€”
How many lives do you think you took
to carry out that plan of yours?!
Stop, Kurapika!
Stop it!
If the merchandise is in safe hands,
we don't need him.
We'll hand him over to the community.
So, no deal?
Oh, did you find out what
became of the merchandise?
Shut up! Ask Feitan!
Did he tell you where the merchandise is?
It was no fun...
I'd barely gotten started, but he gave in.
Oh, so that's it.
Ah, I just remembered.
I was supposed to meet someone today.
I'll be heading out.
Sure, go ahead.
As long as you return by 6 PM tomorrow.
Up to some mischief, Hisoka?
But of course.
Damn...
"Let us meet at the agreed upon place."
Where's Shalnark?
He just called.
He's succeeded in locating
a Mafia comms room.
This is Dalzollene of the Nostrade Family.
We've captured one of the bandits
who attacked the auction
and wish to hand him over.
Really?
How did you manage that?
I can provide further details later.
That's impressive...
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance.
The Shadow Beasts never stood a chance?
Yeah, they were completely wiped out.
Wiped out...
Well, where are you right now?
Okay, got it.
Move quickly.
Yeah, we'll bring our best people.
I gave him three canisters
of muscle relaxants.
Understood.
The Mafia will be here soon.
I'll watch him until then,
so get some rest, everyone.
Yeah.
You move fast.
He isn't using In.
No need for concern.
I have no interest in fighting you now...
I'm not here for idle chat!
Tell me about your organization.
Really?
I love idle chat.
There are thirteen spiders,
identifiable by their
numbered spider tattoos.
Members can change at
a moment's notice.
An applicant defeating a standing
member replaces them.
If the Troupe loses one for other reasons,
the boss selects the replacement.
The Troupe focuses primarily
on stealing and killing.
Sometimes, they perform
philanthropic work.
I already know all of that.
Two or three years ago,
I replaced the man who was #4.
For what purpose?
So that I could fight the boss.
The boss?
Why would you want that?
Because he is strong...
You wished to test your strength?
Perhaps.
But...
It turns me on...
Thinking about fighting the boss...
But I've never had the chance.
He never lowers his guard.
At a minimum, two others
always accompany him.
And when a job ends, he vanishes.
Without a trace.
So I reached a conclusion
that benefits us both.
Would you not agree that reaching
our goals alone will be difficult?
What are you trying to say?
I can tell you the Troupe members' abilities.
There are seven whose
powers I already know.
Interested...
in teaming up?
Yeah, we're on floor B2.
Thanks.
You haven't killed him yet?
No.
This way.
We couldn't get a needle into him,
so we used paralytic gas.
You clean up nicely.
Huh?
I couldn't believe my ears
when I heard you'd been kidnapped.
Blinky, time for work.
Suck out the poison paralyzing Uvo.
Okay, all done.
Damn!
I'm gonna make that chain user pay...
Wake up, everyone!
Where is he?!
He ran away.
You were too loud.
We're heading back.
Our job here is done.
We also dealt with the Shadow Beasts.
And we got our treasure.
No!
Tell the boss...
I won't go back until I settle up
with that chain user.
Uvogin has been freed.
Kurapika, invited by Hisoka to team up,
is not yet aware of this.
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Brush Your Teeth.
Unripe Fruit
Coming up, we have Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
It's Gon
and Killua's
Hunterpedia!
Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia
Today, we introduce Dalzollene.
Leads Neon's bodyguards.
He's the leader of Neon's bodyguards!
A cruel, impatient man who disposes
of any who fail to follow orders.
Must be a drag taking care of that selfish brat!
It's a drag for me, taking care of you.
What are you on about?!
Next time: Chasing x And x Waiting.
Hey, Killua,
let's play Drop the Handkerchief.
I'll drop it, and you sit and wait.
You can't play that with two people!
